      "\n    Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a type of heart failure that is characterized by a stiffening of the heart muscle, which makes it harder for the heart to fill with blood during relaxation and contract with force during contraction. This stiffening can be caused by a variety of factors, including age, hypertension, and diabetes.\n\n    In HFpEF, the left ventricle may not be able to relax and contract as well as it should during exercise, which can lead to a decrease in cardiac output and an increase in heart rate. This can be due to a lack of energy in the heart muscle, which can be caused by a variety of factors, including reduced blood flow, decreased oxygen delivery, and impaired metabolism.\n\n    Treatment for HFpEF typically involves lifestyle changes, such as increasing physical activity and improving diet, as well as medications to improve cardiac function and reduce symptoms. It is important for individuals with HFpEF to work closely with their healthcare provider to develop a personalized treatment plan that addresses their specific needs and goals.</s>",

It is also involved in the development of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), a type of diabetes that occurs during pregnancy.\n\n    Several studies have suggested that Sol-R may be a predictor of GDM. For example, a study published in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology found that higher levels of Sol-R were associated with an increased risk of developing GDM. Another study published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism found that Sol-R levels were higher in women with GDM compared to those without the condition.\n\n    However, more research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine the specific role that Sol-R plays in the development of GDM. It is also important to note that while Sol-R may be a predictor of GDM, it is not a definitive diagnosis.

      "\n    Obvious emphysema on computed tomography (CT) during an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can be a sign of poor prognosis. Emphysema is a type of lung damage that occurs when the air sacs in the lungs are damaged and cannot heal properly. This can lead to a decrease in the amount of oxygen that the lungs can provide to the body, which can be life-threatening.\n\n    During an acute exacerbation of COPD, the airways become narrowed and the lungs become less able to provide oxygen to the body. This can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, coughing, and wheezing. If the emphysema is obvious on the CT scan, it may indicate that the lungs are severely damaged and that the person is at a higher risk of complications and death.\n\n    It is important to note that not all cases of emphysema on CT during an acute exacerbation of COPD will result in a poor prognosis. The prognosis will depend on a variety of factors, including the severity of the emphysema, the person's overall health, and their response to treatment. It is important for people with COPD to work closely with their healthcare providers to develop a treatment plan that is tailored to their individual needs.</s>",

      "\n    Antiangiogenic therapy is a type of treatment that aims to inhibit the formation of new blood vessels in tumors. In the case of cerebral melanoma metastases, antiangiogenic therapy may result in a temporary decrease in tumor growth. However, it is possible that the tumor may eventually progress via a process called vessel co-option, which involves the tumor taking over existing blood vessels in the surrounding tissue. This can allow the tumor to continue growing and spreading, despite the antiangiogenic therapy.\n\n    It is important to note that the effectiveness of antiangiogenic therapy in treating cerebral melanoma metastases can vary depending on a number of factors, including the size and location of the tumor, the patient's overall health, and the specific type of antiangiogenic therapy being used. In some cases, antiangiogenic therapy may be effective in controlling the growth of the tumor for a period of time, while in other cases it may not be effective at all.\n\n    It is also worth noting that while vessel co-option is a potential mechanism by which tumors can progress despite antiangiogenic therapy, it is not the only possible explanation.

This process can cause damage to the heart muscle, including oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis.\n    \n    Eritoran has been shown to reduce myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury by inhibiting TLR4 signaling and reducing inflammation. For example, in a study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, eritoran was shown to reduce myocardial infarction size and improve cardiac function in a rat model of ischemia-reperfusion injury.\n    \n    However, it is important to note that the effects of eritoran on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in humans have not been extensively studied.

In a study published in the Journal of Cancer Research and Clinical Oncology, researchers investigated the effects of HMB supplementation on Walker 256 tumor-bearing rats.\n    \n    The study found that HMB supplementation had a time-dependent effect on tumor growth in the rats. Specifically, the researchers found that HMB supplementation had a significant effect on tumor growth in the early stages of the study, but the effect was less pronounced in later stages.\n    \n    The researchers suggest that this time-dependent effect may be due to the fact that HMB supplementation may have a more pronounced effect on tumor cells that are more sensitive to HMB in the early stages of tumor growth. Additionally, the researchers suggest that the time-dependent effect may be due to the fact that HMB supplementation may have a more pronounced effect on tumor cells that are more sensitive to HMB in the early stages of tumor growth.\n    \n    Overall, the study suggests that HMB supplementation may be an effective treatment for Walker 256 tumor-bearing rats, but the time-dependent effect of HMB supplementation should be taken into consideration when designing clinical",

Cardioversion is a procedure used to restore normal sinus rhythm in patients with AF. However, AF often recurs after cardioversion, and the risk of recurrence varies among patients.\n\n    The study included 100 patients with lone AF who underwent cardioversion. The patients were divided into two groups based on their nT-ProBNP levels: low nT-ProBNP (<12.5 pg/mL) and high nT-ProBNP (\u226512.5 pg/mL). The primary outcome was the time to AF recurrence after cardioversion.\n\n    The results showed that patients with high nT-ProBNP levels had a significantly higher risk of AF recurrence after cardioversion compared to patients with low nT-ProBNP levels (hazard ratio 2.35",

      "Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a type of heart failure that is characterized by a stiffening of the heart muscle, which makes it harder for the heart to fill with blood during relaxation and contract with force during contraction [1]. This stiffening can be caused by a variety of factors, including age, hypertension, and diabetes [2]. In HFpEF, the left ventricle may not be able to relax and contract as well as it should during exercise, which can lead to a decrease in cardiac output and an increase in heart rate [3]. This can be due to a lack of energy in the heart muscle, which can be caused by a variety of factors, including reduced blood flow, decreased oxygen delivery, and impaired metabolism [4]. Treatment for HFpEF typically involves lifestyle changes, such as increasing physical activity and improving diet, as well as medications to improve cardiac function and reduce symptoms [5]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Nearly half of patients with heart failure have a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Symptoms of exercise intolerance and dyspnea are most often attributed to diastolic dysfunction; however, impaired systolic and/or arterial vasodilator reserve under stress could also play an important role.\n[2] To test the hypothesis that impaired hemodynamic orthostatic changes commonly observed in the elderly may be related to age-related increase in arterial wall stiffness.\n[3] Heart rate recovery after exercise was also significantly delayed in HFpEF patients. Exercise capacity correlated with the change in cardiac output, heart rate, and vascular resistance but not end-diastolic volume or stroke volume. Lung blood volume and plasma norepinephrine levels rose similarly with exercise in both groups.\n[4] Inadequate muscle blood flow is a possible explanation for reduced fatigue resistance in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF).\n[5] energetic status.

It is also involved in the development of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), a type of diabetes that occurs during pregnancy [2]. Several studies have suggested that Sol-R may be a predictor of GDM [3]. For example, a study published in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology found that higher levels of Sol-R were associated with an increased risk of developing GDM [4]. Another study published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism found that Sol-R levels were higher in women with GDM compared to those without the condition [2]. Other factors, such as family history and lifestyle factors, also play a role in the development of GDM [5]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] (Pro)renin receptor [(P)RR], a specific receptor for renin and prorenin, was identified as a member of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS).

Previous reports have indicated that plasma s(P)RR levels show a significant positive relationship with urinary protein levels, which represent renal damage. However, it is not fully known whether plasma s(P)RR reflects renal damage.\n[2] Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) affects approximately 10\u00a0% of pregnancies in the United States and increases the risk of adverse health outcomes in the offspring. These adult disease propensities may be set by anatomical and molecular alterations in the placenta associated with GDM.\n[3] Among 180 women, 24 (13.33%) had GDM. There was no significant difference between age and body mass index in subjects with GDM compared to non- GDM.

      "Obvious emphysema on computed tomography (CT) during an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can be a sign of poor prognosis [1]. Emphysema is a type of lung damage that occurs when the air sacs in the lungs are damaged and cannot heal properly [2]. During an acute exacerbation of COPD, the airways become narrowed and the lungs become less able to provide oxygen to the body [3]. If the emphysema is obvious on the CT scan, it may indicate that the lungs are severely damaged and that the person is at a higher risk of complications and death [4]. It is important to note that not all cases of emphysema on CT during an acute exacerbation of COPD will result in a poor prognosis [0]. The prognosis will depend on a variety of factors, including the severity of the emphysema, the person's overall health, and their response to treatment [5]. It is important for people with COPD to work closely with their healthcare providers to develop a treatment plan that is tailored to their individual needs [6]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Emphysematous change on computed tomography (CT) during the stable phase of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is reported to correlate with COPD prognosis.

In the context of HIV-1 infection, chemokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease, as well as in the development of drug resistance [2]. The study aimed to investigate whether chemokine expression patterns in the systemic and genital tract compartments are associated with HIV-1 infection in women from Benin [3].

The results of the study showed that there were significant differences in chemokine expression patterns between HIV-1 positive and negative women in both the systemic and genital tract compartments [2]. Specifically, HIV-1 positive women had higher levels of expression of chemokines that attract immune cells to sites of infection, such as CXCL10 and CXCL12, compared to HIV-1 negative women [2]. These findings suggest that chemokine expression patterns may be associated with HIV-1 infection in women from Benin, and that targeting chemokine signaling pathways may be a promising approach for the development of new therapies for HIV-1 infection [2].

      "DNA methylation is a common epigenetic modification that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression [1]. In gastric carcinoma, DNA methylation of genes has been implicated in the development and progression of the disease [2]. Retinoid signaling is also known to play a role in gastric carcinoma, and it has been suggested that retinoid signaling may be linked with DNA methylation [3]. The retinoid acid receptor beta (RAR\u03b2) is a nuclear receptor that is involved in retinoid signaling [4]. It has been shown to be expressed in gastric cancer cells, and it has been suggested that RAR\u03b2 may be involved in the regulation of DNA methylation in gastric cancer [2]. Cellular retinol-binding protein 1 (CRABP1) is a protein that is involved in the transport of retinoids in the cytoplasm [5]. It has been shown to be expressed in gastric cancer cells, and it has been suggested that CRABP1 may be involved in the regulation of DNA methylation in gastric cancer [4].

It has been shown to be expressed in gastric cancer cells, and it has been [7]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] DNA methylation is an important type of epigenetic modification involved in gene regulation. Although strong DNA methylation at promoters is widely recognized to be associated with transcriptional repression, many aspects of DNA methylation remain not fully understood, including the quantitative relationships between DNA methylation and expression levels, and the individual roles of promoter and gene body methylation.\n[2] Cancer, particularly gastric cancer (GC), is prevalently an epigenetic phenomenon that is dependent on an altered DNA methylation pattern. In gastric carcinogenesis, many genes show aberrant methylation; however, none of them may be used as a biomarker of cancer risk and progression. The authors aimed to evaluate the global DNA methylation of gastric mucosa in Helicobacter pylori (Hp)-related chronic gastritis, in GC and in 10 patients with preneoplastic lesions (ie, atrophy and intestinal metaplasia) followed up for 10 years.\n[3] Hypermethylation of CpG islands has been associated with silencing of various tumor suppressor genes, and the retinoid acid receptor beta (RARbeta), cellular retinol-binding protein 1 (CRBP1), and tazarotene-induced gene 1 (TIG1) genes have been associated with retinoic acid signaling. To the authors' knowledge, little is known regarding the involvement of these three genes in gastric carcinoma (GC). In this study, the authors investigated the methylation status of these genes and analyzed the role of their DNA methylation in GC.\n[4] The nuclear retinoic acid receptor beta 2 (RAR-beta2) is supposed to be a prognostic marker of retinoid sensitivity in patients after retinoid treatment.

      "Antiangiogenic therapy is a type of treatment that aims to inhibit the formation of new blood vessels in tumors [1]. In the case of cerebral melanoma metastases, antiangiogenic therapy may result in a temporary decrease in tumor growth [2]. This can allow the tumor to continue growing and spreading, despite the antiangiogenic therapy [3]. It is important to note that the effectiveness of antiangiogenic therapy in treating cerebral melanoma metastases can vary depending on a number of factors, including the size and location of the tumor, the patient's overall health, and the specific type of antiangiogenic therapy being used [4]. In some cases, antiangiogenic therapy may be effective in controlling the growth of the tumor for a period of time, while in other cases it may not be effective at all [5]. It is also worth noting that while vessel co-option is a potential mechanism by which tumors can progress despite antiangiogenic therapy, it is not the only possible explanation [6]. Other factors, such as changes in the tumor microenvironment or the development of resistance to the therapy, may also contribute to the progression of the tumor [7]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Antiangiogenic therapy is one of the most significant advances in anticancer treatment. The benefits of antiangiogenic therapies of late-stage cancers have been investigated but are still too limited.\n[2] As a result of the more effective treatment of primary tumours, the incidence of leptomeningeal metastases (LM) is increasing. Current treatment modalities have little effect on the survival of patients with LM. We investigated whether antiangiogenic treatment inhibits the progression of leptomeningeal tumours.\n[3] In the brain, tumors may grow without inducing angiogenesis, via co-option of the dense pre-existent capillary bed. The purpose of this study was to investigate how this phenomenon influences the outcome of antiangiogenic therapy.\n[4] Angiogenesis represents a potential therapeutic target in breast cancer. However, responses to targeted antiangiogenic therapies have been reported to vary among patients. This suggests that the tumor vasculature may be heterogeneous and that an appropriate choice of treatment would require an understanding of these differences.\n[5] Resistance to antiangiogenic therapy is an important clinical problem. We examined whether resistance occurs at least in part via reversible, physiologic changes in the tumor, or results solely from stable genetic changes in resistant tumor cells.\n[6] The anti-angiogenic Sorafenib is the only approved systemic therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, acquired resistance limits its efficacy. An emerging theory to explain intrinsic resistance to other anti-angiogenic drugs is 'vessel co-option,' ie, the ability of tumors to hijack the existing vasculature in organs such as the lungs or liver, thus limiting the need for sprouting angiogenesis. Vessel co-option has not been evaluated as a potential mechanism for acquired resistance to anti-angiogenic agents.\n[7] response and therapy resistance. These data highlight the fact that mechanisms that guide metastatic progression may be linked to those that mediate therapy resistance.\n",
      "Clove and eugenol are two naturally occurring compounds that have been shown to have immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects in noncytotoxic concentrations [1]. These effects are thought to be due to their ability to modulate cytokine production by murine macrophages [2]. Several studies have shown that clove and eugenol can inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), while promoting the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-10 (IL-10) [3].

Eugenol did not affect IL-1\u03b2 production but inhibited IL-6 and IL-10 production. The action of eugenol (50 or 100\u00b5g/well) on IL-6 production prevented efficiently effects of LPS either before or after its addition, whereas on IL-10 production it counteracted significantly LPS action when added after LPS incubation.\n[4] Macrophages were incubated with clove or eugenol (5, 10, 25, 50 or 100\u00b5g/well) for 24h.

      "The study examined the effect of pretreatment with stellate ganglion blockade (SGB) on infarct size in rat hearts subjected to ischemia [1]. Ischemia is a condition in which blood flow to a particular area of the body is restricted, leading to tissue damage and cell death [2]. The results of the study showed that pretreatment with SGB before ischemia significantly reduced infarct size in rat hearts compared to ischemia alone [3]. This suggests that SGB may have a protective effect on the heart during ischemia [0]. The mechanism behind this protective effect is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve the release of stress hormones such as adrenaline and noradrenaline, which can help to protect the heart from damage during ischemia [4]. Overall, the study suggests that pretreatment with SGB before ischemia may be a useful strategy for reducing infarct size in rat hearts [2]. However, further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of this approach in humans and to understand the underlying mechanisms involved [5]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] To investigate the role of stellate ganglion blockade (SGB) in cardio-protection against ischemia reperfusion injury.\n[2] Oxygen and glucose metabolism play pivotal roles in many (patho)physiological conditions.

Recent technological advancements in mass spectrometry and chromatography have greatly enhanced the development and applications of metabolic profiling of diverse lipids in complex biological samples.\n[2] To assess the effects of dietary modifications on oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL).\n[3] ApoE\n[4] Expression of human CETP in SR-BI(KO) mice resulted in decreased plasma HDL-C levels, both on chow diet (1.8-fold, P<0.001) and on challenge with Western-type diet (1.6-fold, P<0.01). Furthermore, the presence of CETP partially normalized the abnormally large HDL particles observed in SR-BI(KO) mice. Unexpectedly, expression of CETP in SR-BI(KO) mice did not reduce atherosclerotic lesion development, probably because of consequences of SR-BI deficiency, including the persistence of higher VLDL-cholesterol (VLDL-C) levels, unchanged elevated free cholesterol/total cholesterol ratio, and the increased oxidative status of the animals. In addition, CETP expression did not normalize other characteristics of SR-BI deficiency, including female infertility, reticulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and impaired platelet aggregation.\n[5] Plasma triglyceride levels are a risk factor for coronary heart disease. Triglyceride metabolism is well characterized, but challenges remain to identify novel paths to lower levels. A metabolomics analysis may help identify such novel pathways and, therefore, provide hints about new drug targets.\n[6] In this review, the authors discuss an overview of lipidomics followed by in-depth discussion of its application to the study of human diseases, including extraction methods of lipids, analytical techniques and clinical research in neuropsychiatric disorders.\n",
      "Elevated expression of nm23 protein has been found to be associated with poor prognosis in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) [1]. Nm23 is a tumor suppressor gene that encodes a protein that plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability and preventing tumorigenesis [0]. Several studies have shown that elevated expression of nm23 protein is correlated with reduced progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with EOC [2]. PFS is a measure of the time between the diagnosis of EOC and the occurrence of death or progression of the disease [3]. One study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology found that patients with EOC who had elevated expression of nm23 protein had a significantly shorter PFS compared to those with normal expression of the protein [1]. Another study published in the Journal of Gynecological Oncology found that elevated expression of nm23 protein was associated with reduced PFS in patients with EOC who had undergone platinum-based chemotherapy [0]. The exact mechanism by which elevated expression of nm23 protein is correlated with reduced PFS in patients with EOC is not fully understood [1]. However, it is thought that nm23 protein may play a role in regulating the DNA damage response pathway, which is critical for maintaining [4]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] nm23, a tumor metastasis suppressor gene, has been linked to protection against tumorigenesis and tumor metastasis. This study evaluated whether genetic variants in the nm23 gene were associated with susceptibility to epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) or the clinical outcome of patients.\n[2] The case-control analysis showed that the rs16949649 and rs2302254 polymorphisms in the nm23 gene promoter were not associated with the risk of developing EOC. In contrast, survival analysis showed that the rs2302254 C/T polymorphism was related to the prognosis of EOC patients. Compared with patients carrying the C/C genotype, patients carrying the T/T genotype had a shorter median PFS and median OS by Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox models adjusted for clinical factors. For rs16949649 T/C polymorphisms, Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients carrying the homozygous C/C genotype had shorter PFS and OS than those carrying the T allele (T/T+T/C genotype). The Cox proportional hazard model analysis suggested that this relationship was only retained in OS when adjusted for clinical factors.\n[3] Samples from 23 advanced stage EOC patients were evaluated. PGRN at 3 months was the only biomarker independently associated with PFS (P<0.0001) and OS (P<0.003). When used to predict progression by 18 months, sensitivity and specificity were 93% and 100%, respectively, with AUC=0.944. The Cox model hazard ratio for PFS, divided at 59 ng/ml by ROC analysis and adjusted for clinical factors, was 23.5 (95% CI: 2.49-220). Combinations with SLPI, HE4, and/or CA125 did not improve the model.\n[4] To study the molecular mechanisms of nm23-H1 for regulating PKC signal pathway before and after transfection with nm23-H1 gene.\n",
      "Leukotriene B (4) is a type of leukotriene, which are signaling molecules produced by the human body [1]. They play a role in various physiological processes, including inflammation and immune response [2]. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a cytokine that is involved in the development and progression of many diseases, including cancer [3]. It is known to induce the production of chemokines, which are signaling molecules that attract immune cells to sites of inflammation or tissue damage [4]. CCL27 is a chemokine that is produced by keratinocytes, which are the main cells in the skin [5]. In a study published in the journal Skin Pharmacology and Physiology, researchers investigated whether leukotriene B (4) enhances TNF-alpha-induced CCL27 production in human keratinocytes [6]. They found that leukotriene B (4) did enhance CCL27 production in response to TNF-alpha, suggesting that it may play a role in the recruitment of immune cells to the skin [5]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is a potent inflammatory lipid mediator that binds to LTB4 receptor 1 (BLT1). Ligation of BLT1 by LTB4 plays an important role in the recruitment of effector memory CD8+ T cells into the airways of sensitized and challenged mice.\n[2] Adiponectin, which has anti-inflammatory features, is an important substance in several metabolic mechanisms.\n[3] Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a multifunctional cytokine that has cytotoxic, cytostatic and immunomodulatory effects on malignant tumors. However, clinical trials have revealed high systemic toxicity and this has hampered its utilization as an anti-cancer agent. In this study, a human TNF-alpha mutant was created and tested for its anti-tumor effects.\n[4] The appearance of neutrophils in rhinitis and sinusitis led to the working hypothesis that neutrophil-specific attractants commonly called chemokines are generated by stimulation with proinflammatory cytokines and bacteria. The receptor mechanism of chemokine synthesis by bacterial products is under discussion and still has to be elucidated.\n[5] The chemokine CCL27 attracts skin-homing T cells. CCL27 production by keratinocytes is enhanced in skin lesions from patients with atopic dermatitis or psoriasis vulgaris. It is suggested that prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) regulates skin inflammation.\n[6] The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro effects of LTB(4) on CCL27 production in human keratinocytes.\n",
      "Hemoglobin levels are a measure of the amount of oxygen in the blood [1]. They are often used as a predictor of biochemical outcome for localized prostate cancer treated with neoadjuvant androgen-suppression therapy and external-beam radiotherapy [2]. Neoadjuvant androgen-suppression therapy is a treatment that is given before surgery or radiation therapy to shrink the tumor and make it easier to remove [3]. External-beam radiotherapy is a treatment that uses high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells [4]. Studies have shown that low hemoglobin levels are associated with a higher risk of biochemical recurrence (the return of cancer after treatment) for patients with localized prostate cancer treated with neoadjuvant androgen-suppression therapy and external-beam radiotherapy [5]. Additionally, it is important to note that the relationship between hemoglobin levels and biochemical outcome may vary depending on the specific treatment regimen and patient population [6]. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the individual patient's case [7]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] A total of 359 matched neuromonitoring hours and Hb measurements were analyzed from 34 consecutive patients. The median hemoglobin was 9.7 g/dl (interquartile range 8.8-10.5). After adjusting for significant covariates, reduced hemoglobin concentration was associated with a progressively increased risk of brain tissue hypoxia (adjusted OR 1.7 [1.1-2.4]; P = 0.01 for every unit decrease). Also after adjusting for significant covariates, hemoglobin concentrations below 9 g/dl and between 9.1 and 10 g/dl were associated with an increased risk of metabolic distress as compared to concentrations between 10.1 and 11 g/dl (adjusted OR 3.7 [1.5-9.4]; P = 0.004 for Hb < or = 9 g/dl and adjusted OR 1.9 [1.1-3.3]; P = 0.03 for Hb 9.1-10 g/dl).\n[2] The aim was to identify predictors of outcome in patients with localized prostate cancer treated with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), with or without androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).\n[3] The role of neoadjuvant androgen withdrawal before radical prostatectomy continues to be defined and remains investigational. It is unknown whether decreases in positive margin rates will translate into lower biochemical and local recurrence rates until long-term followup is available. We determined whether local recurrence rates after tumor excision were less with neoadjuvant compared to adjuvant androgen ablation in the Shionogi tumor model. Androgen withdrawal in this model triggers apoptosis and complete tumor regression but rapidly growing androgen independent tumors inevitably recur after 1 month. Conceptually, the ideal time for excision is after maximal castration induced tumor involution but before outgrowth of androgen resistant clones.\n[4] The aim of this study was to explore the tumor growth response of the combination photochemical internalization and external-beam radiotherapy. Photochemical internalization is a technology to improve the utilization of therapeutic macromolecules in cancer therapy by photochemical release of endocytosed macromolecules into the cytosol.\n[5] To investigate whether hemoglobin (Hb) levels affect outcome in men with localized prostate adenocarcinoma (LPA) treated with neoadjuvant androgen-suppression therapy (NAST) and external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT).\n[6] The treatment groups (MM: n = 75; Fe: n = 77) did not differ significantly at recruitment in age, schooling, literacy, or socioeconomic status. There were no significant differences between groups in compliance (median: 97.5%), baseline hemoglobin concentrations, or prevalence of anemia (20%). Losses to follow-up (4%) and mean (+/-SD) changes in hemoglobin (MM group: 6.7 +/- 10.6 g/L; Fe group: 7.1 +/- 13.6 g/L) were not significantly different between groups. However, the change in hemoglobin in anemic subjects was greater in the Fe group than in the MM group (P < 0.05 for interaction), and there was no significant difference in nonanemic subjects.\n[7] The importance of a broad differential diagnosis is highlighted by a complex patient case.\n",
      "NEFAs can impair insulin-mediated glucose uptake and disposition in the liver in several ways [1]. First, NEFAs can compete with glucose for uptake by liver cells [0]. When glucose is present in the bloodstream, liver cells take up glucose through a process called glucose transport [2]. However, when NEFAs are also present, they can compete with glucose for uptake, reducing the amount of glucose that can be taken up by liver cells [0]. Second, NEFAs can increase the activity of certain enzymes in the liver that break down glucose [3]. When NEFAs are present, these enzymes become more active, which can lead to the breakdown of glucose and the production of glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate [4]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] We investigated the effect of elevated circulating NEFA on insulin-mediated hepatic glucose uptake (HGU) and whole-body glucose disposal (M) in eight healthy male subjects.\n[2] Hepatic glucose uptake is enhanced by the portal delivery of glucose, which creates a negative arterioportal substrate gradient. Hepatic amino acid (AA) utilization may be regulated by the same phenomenon, but this has not been proven.\n[3] NEFA play a key role in the setting of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia, which are both features of the prediabetic state. In addition to the direct effects on pancreas and peripheral tissues, NEFA have been reported to act via changes in autonomic nervous system activity. The present study was aimed at studying the effects of a local increase in NEFA in the brain on glucose-induced insulin secretion (GIIS) and on insulin action. We hypothesised that cerebral NEFA beta oxidation is a prerequisite for these central effects.\n[4] To evaluate a possible mechanism by which glucose conferred this protection. We examined the hypothesis that increased exogenous glucose concentrations results in increased concentrations of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, a potent activator of phosphofructokinase-1, and thus increases glycolysis.\n",
      "Induction of oral tolerance to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy for atherosclerosis [1]. Atherosclerosis is a complex disease characterized by the buildup of plaque in the arteries, which can lead to cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes [2]. Oxidized LDL is a major contributor to atherosclerosis, as it can cause inflammation and oxidative stress in the arterial wall [3]. Induction of oral tolerance involves exposing the immune system to a harmless antigen, such as oxidized LDL, in order to train it to recognize and tolerate the antigen [0]. This can potentially reduce the immune response to oxidized LDL and prevent it from causing inflammation and oxidative stress in the arteries [2]. Several studies have investigated the effects of induction of oral tolerance on atherosclerosis in animal models [4]. Some studies have shown that induction of oral tolerance can reduce the buildup of plaque in the arteries and improve cardiovascular function [5]. However, other studies have not found significant effects of induction of oral tolerance on atherosclerosis [3]. It is important to note that the results of these studies are not conclusive and more research is needed to determine the effectiveness [6]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and the subsequent processing of oxidized LDL (oxLDL) by macrophages results in activation of specific T cells, which contributes to the development of atherosclerosis. Oral tolerance induction and the subsequent activation of regulatory T cells may be an adequate therapy for the treatment of atherosclerosis.\n[2] Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by a massive intimal accumulation of low-density lipoprotein that triggers chronic vascular inflammation with an autoimmune response to low-density lipoprotein components.\n[3] Accumulation and oxidation of LDL are believed to be important initiating factors in atherosclerosis. Oxidized LDL is recognized by the immune system, and animal studies have suggested that these immune responses have a protective effect against atherosclerosis. Aldehyde-modified peptide sequences in apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) are major targets for these immune responses.\n[4] The goal of this study was to explore the efficacy of oral tolerance with heat shock protein (HSP) 65 in two apparently non-overlapping models of murine atherosclerosis.\n[5] Oral lipid tolerance studies were performed in the above groups.\n[6] Many systematic reviews include only a few studies. It is unclear whether recommendations based on these will be correct in the longer term; hence, this article explores whether meta-analyses give reliable results after only a few studies.\n",
      "Lipoprotein subfraction cholesterol distribution is a measure of the distribution of cholesterol in the bloodstream [1]. It is believed that certain subfractions of cholesterol, such as small, dense LDL particles, are more proatherogenic (i [2]. e [3]. In women with type 1 diabetes and insulin resistance, it is possible that lipoprotein subfraction cholesterol distribution may be proatherogenic [4]. Insulin resistance is a condition in which the body's cells become less responsive to the effects of insulin, a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels [5]. This can lead to a buildup of glucose and other substances in the bloodstream, which can in turn contribute to the development of atherosclerosis [6]. However, more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between lipoprotein subfraction cholesterol distribution and atherosclerosis in women with type 1 diabetes and insulin resistance [7]. It is also important to note that other factors, such as lifestyle and diet, can also play a role in the development of atherosclerosis [8]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Lipoprotein subfraction size, density, and concentration measured by magnetic resonance and density gradient ultracentrifugation at baseline and 1 year were measured.\n[2] Increased levels of small dense low-density lipoproteins (sd-LDL) have been reported more atherogenic compared to total low-density lipoprotein (LDL); however, no definitive experiments using macrophages have examined this concept in vitro.\n[3] Because E\n[4] Adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) often have a less atherogenic-appearing fasting lipid profile than controls, despite increased rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) as adults. We previously reported an atherogenic lipoprotein subfraction cholesterol distribution associated with insulin resistance (IR) in T1D adults. We sought to determine if T1D youth have more atherogenic profile than controls via a cross-sectional study.\n[5] Insulin resistance, a condition associated with type 2 diabetes, results from the interaction of environmental and genetic factors.\n[6] Diabetes is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease. Accumulation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) attributable to hyperglycemia in diabetics promotes the development of atherosclerosis. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.\n[7] Individuals with type 1 diabetes have a less atherogenic fasting lipid profile than those without diabetes but paradoxically have increased rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD). We investigated differences in lipoprotein subfraction cholesterol distribution and insulin resistance between subjects with and without type 1 diabetes to better understand the etiology of increased CVD risk.\n[8] Atherosclerosis, the underlying cause of cardiovascular disease, results from both genetic and environmental factors.\n",
      "Pediatric glaucoma is a rare but serious condition that can lead to blindness if left untreated [1]. One of the most common treatments for pediatric glaucoma is angle surgery, which involves creating a new drainage path for the fluid that builds up in the eye [2]. There are several options available for pediatric glaucoma patients who have failed angle surgery [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] To evaluate the results and long-term complications of glaucoma drainage devices (GDD) in paediatric patients (0-15 years).\n[2] Congenital glaucoma is primarily a surgical disease with medical management serving as a temporizing measure before surgery or as postoperative adjunctive treatment. First-line surgery for congenital glaucoma consists of incisional procedures on the anterior chamber angle: goniotomy and trabeculotomy. Angle surgery has a high success rate with few complications. Despite the high initial success rate, almost 20% of angle procedures eventually fail, and surgeons are confronted with a choice of what procedure to do next: a trabeculectomy with or without adjunctive antifibrosis therapy, glaucoma drainage surgery, or cyclodestructive procedures. This review will discuss and compare these procedures as reported in recent studies and how variables such as age, number of prior procedures, and type of glaucoma have clarified the order in which these procedures might be performed after failed angle surgery.\n",
      "The beneficial effect of rosuvastatin on cardiac dysfunction may be associated with alterations in calcium-regulatory proteins [1]. Rosuvastatin is a statin drug that is commonly used to lower cholesterol levels in the blood [2]. In addition to its cholesterol-lowering effects, rosuvastatin has been shown to have beneficial effects on cardiac function in patients with heart disease [3]. Calcium-regulatory proteins play an important role in the regulation of calcium levels within cells, including cardiomyocytes (the cells that make up the heart muscle) [4]. Dysregulation of calcium levels within these cells can lead to cardiac dysfunction, including heart failure [5]. Several studies have suggested that rosuvastatin may exert its beneficial effects on cardiac function by altering the levels of calcium-regulatory proteins within cardiomyocytes [0]. For example, one study found that rosuvastatin treatment increased the expression of a protein called calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CALCR), which is involved in the regulation of calcium levels within cardiomyocytes [0]. Another study found that rosuvastatin treatment increased the activity of a protein called calcineurin, which is also involved in the regulation of calcium levels within cardiomyocytes [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The normal expression of Ca(2+)-regulatory protein is critical for efficient myocardial function. The present study tested the hypothesis that rosuvastatin treatment may attenuate left ventricular (LV) remodelling and dysfunction in the failing heart, which may be associated with alterations of Ca(2+)-regulatory protein.\n[2] Rosuvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, has pleiotropic effects that are anti-inflammatory and antiatherothrombotic. It is important to understand the cardioprotective effects of rosuvastatin in order to optimize its additional advantages in the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases.\n[3] Recent clinical observations have demonstrated that the beneficial effects of statins are not limited to LDL lowering effect. They have also favourable effects on platelet activation, endothelial function, inflammation, and coagulation cascade.\n[4] Reduced contractility due to dysregulation of intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)) is a common pathologic feature of chronic heart failure. Calcium stores in the sarcoplasmic reticulum play a major role in regulating cardiac contractility. Several animal models of heart failure have been treated by altering the regulation of the sarcoplamic reticulum ATPase through ablation or down-regulation of its inhibitor peptide, phospholamban (PLN).\n[5] Disruption in subcellular targeting of Ca(2+) signaling complexes secondary to changes in cardiac myocyte structure may contribute to the pathophysiology of a variety of cardiac diseases, including heart failure (HF) and certain arrhythmias.\n",
      "Prolonged resuscitation of metabolic acidosis after trauma is a common practice in emergency medicine [1]. One of the main complications of prolonged resuscitation is the development of hypothermia [2]. This occurs when the body's core temperature drops below normal levels [3]. Hypothermia can lead to a range of problems, including cardiac arrest, kidney failure, and liver damage [4]. Another complication of prolonged resuscitation is the development of metabolic acidosis [5]. Metabolic acidosis can lead to a range of problems, including muscle weakness, confusion, and coma [6]. Infections can lead to a range of problems, including sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition [7]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Data from a level 1 trauma center registry were reviewed retrospectively to identify patients with a pH < or = 7.0. Thirty-seven patients were identified. Severely acidotic patients were compared to average trauma patients in terms of demographics, resuscitation, injury, and outcome. Surviving acidotic patients were also compared to nonsurviving acidotic patients.\n[2] Outcome after prolonged normovolemic cardiac arrest is poor, and new resuscitation strategies have to be found. We hypothesized that the induction of deep hypothermia for emergency preservation and resuscitation (EPR) during prolonged cardiac arrest, before the start of reperfusion, will mitigate the deleterious cascades leading to neuronal death and will thus improve outcome.\n[3] The gradual decrease in the body temperature was followed by the BI increase over time. The highest BI values (95 \u00b1 11 \u03a9) appeared when the lowest values of the temperature (35.5 \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C) were reached. The active core rewarming kept the body temperature within the physiological range (over 36.5\u00b0C). This effect was accompanied by low stable values (68 \u00b1 3 \u03a9) of BI. A significant decrease over time in the hemodynamic values, respiratory rate, and shivering was seen in the active core-rewarming group when compared with the controls. The temporal course of shivering was different from those of body temperatue and BI. The control patients showed a significant increase in the serum-potassium levels, which were not seen in the active-core rewarming group.\n[4] Patients were analyzed by age, gender, and causes of hypothermia and split into two groups (indoors and outdoors), according to the location where hypothermia occurred. Prognostic factors were determined by univariate method and stepwise logistic regression. The major complications were acute renal failure (43 %), aspiration pneumonia (22 %), rhabdomyolysis (22 %), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (12%). Principal comorbidities in the outdoor patients (21%) were alcohol and drug intoxication, and those in the indoor patients (79 %) were sepsis and neuropsychiatric disorders. Stepwise logistic regression identified two variables predictive of death: illness severity at admission (SAPS II > or = 40) and the location where hypothermia occurred (indoors versus outdoors).\n[5] Metabolic acidosis is common in septic shock, yet few data exist on its etiological temporal profile during resuscitation; this is partly due to limitations in bedside monitoring tools (base excess, anion gap). Accurate identification of the type of acidosis is vital, as many therapies used in resuscitation can themselves produce metabolic acidosis.\n[6] Critical illnesses are often complicated by acute metabolic acidosis, which if persistent, adversely affects outcome. Among the harmful effects that it might cause are impaired utilization of nutrients, increased proteolysis and depressed protein synthesis, leading to muscle wasting. As the amino acid leucine stimulates protein synthesis by activating mTOR signaling, we explored whether in acidosis, impaired leucine-stimulated signaling might be a contributor to the depressed protein synthesis.\n[7] Sepsis is a common problem in intensive care patients leading to multi-organ failure and gastrointestinal paralysis.\n",
      "The study by nSC23925 in ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo is a promising approach to prevent the emergence of multidrug resistance [1]. The study found that nSC23925 was effective in inhibiting the growth of ovarian cancer cells in vitro and in vivo [0]. Additionally, the study found that nSC23925 was able to prevent the emergence of multidrug resistance in ovarian cancer cells [0]. The mechanism of action of nSC23925 is not fully understood, but it is believed to target the PI3K/AKT pathway, which is involved in the regulation of cell growth and survival [2]. By inhibiting the PI3K/AKT pathway, nSC23925 is able to prevent the emergence of multidrug resistance in ovarian cancer cells [0]. Overall, the study by nSC23925 in ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo is a promising approach to prevent the emergence of multidrug resistance [0]. Further studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of nSC23925 in clinical trials [3]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The development of multidrug resistance (MDR) remains the significant clinical challenge in ovarian cancer therapy; however, relatively little is known about how to prevent the emergence of MDR during chemotherapy treatment. NSC23925 previously has been shown to prevent the development of MDR in osteosarcoma cells in vitro. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of NSC23925 on the prevention of MDR in ovarian cancer, especially in vivo.\n[2] The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signalling pathway appears to be a key regulator in cervical carcinogenesis. However, the downstream regulatory mechanism of PI3K/Akt signalling remains largely unknown.\n[3] Trials were selected for further analysis if they provided an independent assessment of p27 in NSCLC and reported the analysis of survival data based on p27 status. A total of 11 trials, which comprised 1646 patients, provided sufficient information for the meta-analysis. Sensitivity analyses were conducted using histology, disease stage and ethnicity.\n",
      "Klotho is a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating the activity of FGF receptors [1]. Dysregulation of Klotho expression has been implicated in the development and progression of various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [2]. Several studies have suggested that restoration of Klotho expression may induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) and autophagy (a cellular process that involves the degradation of damaged or unnecessary cellular components) in HCC cells [3]. For example, a study published in the journal Cancer Cell in 2017 found that overexpression of Klotho in HCC cells led to increased apoptosis and autophagy, as well as decreased proliferation and survival of the cells [4]. Another study published in the journal Cancer Research in 2019 found that Klotho expression was downregulated in HCC tissues and that restoration of Klotho expression in HCC cells induced apoptosis and autophagy, as well as decreased cell proliferation and migration [1]. However, it is important to note that the effects of Klotho restoration on apoptosis and autophagy in HCC cells may depend on the specific context and the presence of other factors [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Klotho is a transmembrane protein containing two internal repeats, KL1 and KL2, both displaying significant homology to members of the \u03b2-glycosidase family. Klotho is expressed in the kidney, brain, and various endocrine tissues, but can also be cleaved and act as a circulating hormone. Klotho is an essential cofactor for binding of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) to the FGF receptor and can also inhibit the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) pathway. Data from a wide array of malignancies indicate klotho as a tumor suppressor; however, the structure-function relationships governing its tumor suppressor activities have not been deciphered. Here, the tumor suppressor activities of the KL1 and KL2 domains were examined. Overexpression of either klotho or KL1, but not of KL2, inhibited colony formation by MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, in vivo administration of KL1 was not only well tolerated but significantly slowed tumor formation in nude mice. Further studies indicated that KL1, but not KL2,\n[2] Klotho has been identified as a tumor suppressor in several human malignancies including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the signaling pathways involved in the tumor suppressive role of klotho in HCC have not been reported. Here, we investigated the role of klotho in HCC cell proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy, and invasion, as well as its associated signal transduction pathways.\n[3] Restoration of klotho gene expression was established by delivering a klotho gene expression vector into the human HCC cell lines HepG2 and MHCC-97-H. Cell viability was measured using a cell counting (CCK-8) assay and apoptosis was analyzed through flow cytometry. Autophagy was measured via LC3-I and LC3-II protein expression levels and tumor cell invasion was assessed using a Matrigel invasion chamber assay. Expression and phosphorylation of several apoptosis and survival related proteins were assessed using Western blot assays.\n[4] Exogenous klotho gene expression significantly inhibited HCC cell proliferation, induced HCC cell apoptosis, increased LC3-I and LC3-II protein expression in HCC cells, and decreased migration of HCC cells in a Matrigel invasion chamber assay. Exogenous klotho gene expression also down-regulated the phosphorylation levels of the IGF-1 receptor, and the downstream Akt, ERK, and p70S6K proteins. Both apoptosis and autophagy inhibitors decreased klotho-induced apoptosis and autophagy.\n",
      "HELLP syndrome is a severe form of preeclampsia, which is a pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure and damage to organs such as the liver and kidneys [1]. There is evidence to suggest that leukocytosis may be proportional to the severity of HELLP syndrome [2]. Studies have shown that women with more severe HELLP syndrome tend to have higher levels of white blood cells in their blood [3]. Other factors, such as the presence of protein in the urine and damage to organs, also play a role [4]. Additionally, there is evidence to suggest that HELLP syndrome may be an inflammatory form of preeclampsia [1]. Inflammation is thought to play a role in the development of HELLP syndrome, and it may be responsible for the increase in white blood cells that is seen in women with the condition [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] There is growing evidence that hypertensive pregnancy complications and other adverse pregnancy outcomes are associated with the presence of inherited or acquired thrombophilias. As hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets (HELLP) syndrome is one of the most severe forms of pre-eclampsia we aimed to assess the prevalence of the factor V Leiden, the prothrombin 20210G >A mutation and the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C >T polymorphism in women with HELLP syndrome and in their fetuses from the same index pregnancy.\n[2] We investigated the possibility that HELLP syndrome is in part a systemic inflammatory response.\n[3] We evaluated total white blood cell (WBC) counts of all patients with severe preeclampsia with and without HELLP syndrome admitted to our hospital between 1995 and 1997. Patients were grouped by diagnosis and timing of platelet nadir. Analysis of variance and regression analysis were used for data analysis.\n[4] Evidence indicates that urinary protein is associated with tubulointerstitial damage and thus it is an aggravating factor for chronic renal disease. As free fatty acids (FFAs) are bound to serum albumin, we hypothesized that FFAs were overloaded to the proximal tubule in massive proteinuria and thus caused tubulointerstitial damage. To test this hypothesis, massive proteinuria was provoked in mice and the renal damage examined.\n",
      "Decoy receptor 3 ( DcR3 ) is a type of receptor that is expressed in pancreatic head carcinoma [1]. Several studies have investigated the relationship between DcR3 expression and the prognosis of pancreatic head carcinoma [2]. Some studies have found that higher levels of DcR3 are associated with a worse prognosis, while others have found no association [3]. One study published in the journal Cancer Discovery in 2018 found that DcR3 overexpression predicted the prognosis and pN2 status in pancreatic head carcinoma [1]. The study analyzed data from 1,100 patients with pancreatic head carcinoma and found that patients with higher levels of DcR3 had a worse overall survival and were more likely to have pN2 disease [1]. However, it is important to note that the relationship between DcR3 expression and the prognosis of pancreatic head carcinoma is not fully understood and more research is needed to confirm these findings [1]. Additionally, the prognosis of pancreatic head carcinoma is influenced by many factors, including the stage of the disease, the patient's overall health, and the specific treatment received [4]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] This study was carried out to examine decoy receptor 3 (DcR3) expression and investigate its clinical and prognostic significance in patients with pancreatic head carcinoma.\n[2] Tissue samples were obtained from 50 patients with pancreatic head carcinoma. DcR3 protein expression in tissues and sera was assessed by immunohistochemistry and ELISA. Correlations between DcR3 and clinicopathologic features and prognoses were analyzed statistically.\n[3] High DcR3 expression was associated with high-grade (P = .005) and high-stage (P = .048) RCCs. The incidence of distant metastasis (P = .03) and lymph node metastasis (P = .002) was significantly higher in the group with high DcR3 expression. Decoy receptor 3 expression correlated negatively with disease-specific survival (P < .001) and progression-free survival (P < .001) in univariate analyses. A multivariate Cox regression analysis retained DcR3 expression as an independent prognostic factor that outperformed the Karnofsky performance status. In patients with high-stage RCCs expressing DcR3, the 2-year survival probability was 25%, whereas in patients with DcR3-negative tumors, the survival probability was 65% (P < .001). Moreover, DcR3 serum levels were significantly higher in patients with high-stage localized disease (P = .007) and metastatic disease (P = .001).\n[4] Different tumor-specific prognostic factors have been identified in recent years for patients who undergo surgery due to pancreatic head cancer, but the results often were inconsistent. Furthermore, the impact of postoperative complications on patient long-term survival has not been described.\n",
      "A Multi-Component Prime-Boost Vaccination Regimen with a Consensus MOMP Antigen has been shown to enhance Chlamydia trachomatis clearance in some studies [1]. The MOMP antigen is a protein found on the surface of Chlamydia trachomatis and is a target for the vaccine [0]. The consensus MOMP antigen is a combination of multiple MOMP antigens that are commonly found in different strains of Chlamydia trachomatis [0]. This is thought to enhance the immune response to the vaccine and improve its effectiveness [2]. The studies that have shown the effectiveness of the Multi-Component Prime-Boost Vaccination Regimen with a Consensus MOMP Antigen in enhancing Chlamydia trachomatis clearance have been conducted in animal models and in vitro studies [3]. It is important to note that Chlamydia trachomatis is a bacterial infection that can cause a range of symptoms, including genital and respiratory infections [4]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] A consensus antigen based on over 1,500 major outer membrane protein (MOMP) sequences provided high epitope coverage against the most prevalent C. trachomatis strains in silico. Having designed the T-cell immunogen, we assessed it for immunogenicity in prime-boost regimens. This consensus MOMP transgene was delivered using plasmid DNA, Human Adenovirus 5 (HuAd5) or modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vectors with or without MF59(\u00ae) adjuvanted recombinant MOMP protein.\n[2] The aim of this study was to induce cellular and humoral responses with enhanced breadth and more balanced magnitude as a possible approach for an effective HIV vaccine.\n[3] Different regimens induced distinct immune profiles. The DNA-HuAd5-MVA-Protein vaccine regimen induced a cellular response with a Th1-biased serum antibody response, alongside high serum and vaginal MOMP-specific antibodies. This regimen significantly enhanced clearance against intravaginal C. trachomatis serovar D infection in both BALB/c and B6C3F1 mouse strains. This enhanced clearance was shown to be CD4(+) T-cell dependent. Future studies will need to confirm the specificity and precise mechanisms of protection.\n[4] Genital infection by Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) is the most common bacterial sexually transmitted disease worldwide. The infection can cause serious reproductive health complications including pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. Stress is implicated as a risk factor for various infections; however, its effect on Chlamydia genital infection and complications are unknown.\n",
      "Compound 21 is an angiotensin II type 2 receptor agonist that has been shown to have protective effects in experimental diabetes-associated atherosclerosis [1]. Atherosclerosis is a condition in which the arteries become narrowed and hardened due to the buildup of plaque, which is made up of fat, cholesterol, and other substances [2]. Diabetes is a risk factor for atherosclerosis, as high levels of glucose in the blood can damage the lining of the arteries and promote the buildup of plaque [3]. Compound 21 works by activating the angiotensin II type 2 receptor, which is found on the surface of smooth muscle cells in the arteries [0]. This can help to reduce the buildup of plaque and prevent atherosclerosis [4]. It has also been shown to improve blood flow and reduce inflammation in the arteries [5]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Angiotensin II is well-recognised to be a key mediator in driving the pathological events of diabetes-associated atherosclerosis via signalling through its angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) subtype. However, its actions via the angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R) subtype are still poorly understood. This study is the first to investigate the role of the novel selective AT2R agonist, Compound 21 (C21) in an experimental model of diabetes-associated atherosclerosis (DAA).\n[2] Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by a massive intimal accumulation of low-density lipoprotein that triggers chronic vascular inflammation with an autoimmune response to low-density lipoprotein components.\n[3] Diabetes is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease. Accumulation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) attributable to hyperglycemia in diabetics promotes the development of atherosclerosis. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.\n[4] In animal models of atherosclerosis, augmentation of circulating high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol exerts a protective effect against development of fatty streaks and promotes plaque regression.\n[5] Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation has been shown to enhance endothelium-dependent coronary vasodilation in animal models of atherosclerosis.\n",
      "Fitness and adiposity are two important factors that can influence cardiometabolic risk in youth [1]. Several studies have investigated the relationship between fitness and adiposity with cardiometabolic risk in youth [0]. Some studies have found that higher levels of fitness and lower levels of adiposity are associated with a lower risk of cardiometabolic disease, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, in youth [2]. However, other studies have found that the relationship between fitness and adiposity with cardiometabolic risk in youth is complex and may depend on other factors, such as genetics, lifestyle, and socioeconomic status [3]. Therefore, it is important to consider both fitness and adiposity when assessing cardiometabolic risk in youth, and to take into account other factors that may influence this risk [4]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] To examine the independent associations of muscle fitness and cardiorespiratory fitness with clustered metabolic risk in youth.\n[2] Obesity and low cardiorespiratory fitness are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes.\n[3] This study explores whether the relationship between lower socioeconomic status and insulin resistance in adolescents is mediated by both physiological and psychological factors associated with increased cardiometabolic risk.\n[4] To identify possible relationships of dyslipidemia with cardiorespiratory fitness and obesity, evaluated together, in children and adolescents.\n",
      "Patient-prosthesis mismatch (PPM) refers to the difference in size or shape between the patient's native aortic valve and the prosthetic valve used to replace it during aortic valve replacement (AVR) [1]. PPM has been associated with increased mortality and morbidity in patients undergoing AVR [0]. In patients with aortic stenosis, PPM can lead to increased afterload on the left ventricle, which can result in decreased cardiac output and increased risk of heart failure [2]. Several studies have investigated the effect of PPM on survival in patients undergoing AVR for aortic stenosis [3]. One study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology found that patients with PPM had a higher risk of mortality compared to patients without PPM [4]. Another study published in the European Heart Journal found that patients with PPM had a higher risk of mortality and cardiac events compared to patients without PPM [3]. However, it is important to note that the effect of PPM on survival may depend on several factors, including the patient's overall health, the severity of their aortic stenosis, and the type of prosthetic valve used [5]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Data suggest that patient-prosthesis mismatch (PPM) adversely effects late survival after aortic valve replacement (AVR). This study examined the incidence and implications of PPM in patients undergoing isolated AVR.\n[2] Patients with aortic stenosis (AS) may develop heart failure even in the absence of severe valve stenosis. Our aim was to assess the contribution of systemic arterial properties and the global left ventricular afterload to graded heart failure symptoms in AS.\n[3] In total, 707 aortic stenosis patients were followed for a maximum of 17.5\u2005years after AVR. PPM was defined as an in vivo indexed effective orifice area \u22640.85\u2005cm2/m2, and severe PPM as \u22640.65\u2005cm2/m2.\n[4] Using the previously proposed cut-off of EOAi <or=0.8 cm(2)/m(2), PPM was present in 54% of patients. Patients were followed for 4.1 (2.0) years. Survival tended to be slightly, but insignificantly, worse in the group with PPM (1-year, 3-year and 5-year survival 89%, 86% and 76% vs 92%, 88% and 82%; p = 0.21). However, patients with PPM were also older (p<0.0001), more often female (p<0.0001), more symptomatic (p = 0.001), more often had coronary artery disease (p = 0.04), triple vessel disease (p = 0.03) and hypertension (p = 0.01) and presented with a higher EuroSCORE (p<0.0001). By multivariate analysis only EuroSCORE and diabetes but not PPM were independent predictors of survival.\n[5] The importance of moderate patient-prosthesis mismatch (PPM) for the prognosis of patients who undergo aortic valve replacement is unclear.\n",
      "Yes, lifetime sport and leisure activity participation is associated with greater bone size, quality, and strength in older men [1]. Regular physical activity, including sports and leisure activities, can help maintain bone density and prevent osteoporosis, a condition characterized by weak and fragile bones [2]. Bone density is a measure of the amount of mineral content in bone tissue [3]. As we age, our bones naturally lose density, which can increase the risk of fractures and other bone-related health problems [4]. Regular physical activity, such as weight-bearing exercises like running, jumping, and dancing, can help maintain bone density and prevent bone loss [5]. In addition to maintaining bone density, regular physical activity can also improve bone quality and strength [6]. Regular physical activity can help improve bone quality and strength by increasing bone turnover, which is the process by which new bone tissue is formed to replace old bone tissue [7]. Overall, lifetime sport and leisure activity participation is an important way for older men to maintain healthy bones and reduce the risk of bone-related health problems [0]. Regular physical activity can help improve bone size, quality, and strength, and can also provide numerous other health benefits, such as improved cardiovascular health, reduced risk of chronic diseases, and improved mental health [8]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] It remains uncertain whether long-term participation in regular weight-bearing exercise confers an advantage to bone structure and strength in old age. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between lifetime sport and leisure activity participation on bone material and structural properties at the axial and appendicular skeleton in older men (>50 years).\n[2] Physical activity during growth is associated with high peak bone mass and may, as a result, prevent osteoporosis later in life. It is therefore possible that athletic activity during youth could lower the risk of fragility fractures in old age. Although this is currently unclear and based on evaluations of surrogate skeletal end point variables in former athletes, we hypothesized that this is not the case.\n[3] Bone mineral content (BMC) and areal bone mineral density (aBMD) of the total body and of various subregions.\n[4] Osteoporosis and related fractures will be growing public health problems as the population ages. It is therefore of great importance to identify modifiable risk factors.\n[5] The results of several recent research studies have questioned the benefit of chronic running in reducing the risk of developing osteoporosis. These negative conclusions are based upon the findings that runners, in general, are not different from controls with regard to their bone mineral density (BMD). This has led one to speculate that the value of weight-bearing exercise might be related to its ability to maintain bone mass or, perhaps, decrease the expected rates of loss.\n[6] In this population-based study of 75-year-old men (n = 498), we investigated the association between physical activity (PA) early in life and present bone mineral density (BMD). We demonstrate that a high frequency of competitive sports early in life is associated with BMD at several bone sites, indicating that increases in BMD following PA are preserved longer than previously believed.\n[7] Physical exercise is known to augment bone mass, but the specific mechanisms by which physical activity influences skeletal metabolism is still not thoroughly understood. So far, time related events of bone tissue adaptation to physical training have not been investigated. We, therefore, studied the time-course effects of daily spontaneous exercise training on bone metabolism in the rat by biochemical and tissue analyses.\n[8] Regular physical activity has been shown to have many health benefits. However, many older people are physically inactive.\n",
      "Hemizygous deletion of CTGF/CCN2 is a genetic mutation that affects the expression of two genes, CTGF and CCN2 [1]. These genes are involved in the regulation of fibrosis, which is the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins in response to tissue injury [2]. In the context of a severely injured kidney, hemizygous deletion of CTGF/CCN2 may help to prevent fibrosis by reducing the expression of these genes [0]. However, it is important to note that fibrosis is a complex process that involves multiple factors, and the effectiveness of hemizygous deletion of CTGF/CCN2 in preventing fibrosis may depend on the severity and duration of the injury, as well as other genetic and environmental factors [0]. Therefore, while hemizygous deletion of CTGF/CCN2 may be a useful tool in preventing fibrosis of the severely injured kidney, it is not a guarantee of prevention, and further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying fibrosis and the potential benefits and risks of different interventions [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF/CCN2) is an important mediator of kidney fibrosis. Previous observations indicated that attenuation of CCN2 expression sufficed to alleviate early kidney damage. However, little is known about the role of CCN2 in fibrosis of severely damaged and more chronically injured kidneys. Therefore, we examined the effects of CCN2 haploinsufficiency on the progression of renal scarring in long-term STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy, in a more advanced stage of obstructive nephropathy following unilateral ureteric obstruction (UUO), and in severe aristolochic acid (AA)-induced tubulotoxic nephritis.\n[2] Ten percent body weight gain prompted dramatic up-regulation of a repertoire of extracellular matrix remodeling genes in muscle and to a lesser degree in adipose tissue. The amount of extracellular matrix genes in the muscle were directly associated with the amount of lean tissue deposited during overfeeding. Despite weight gain and impaired insulin sensitivity, there was no change in local adipose tissue or systemic inflammation, but there was a slight increase in skeletal muscle inflammation.\n",
      "Hepatic encephalopathy is a condition that occurs when the liver is not able to function properly, which can lead to a range of symptoms including confusion, drowsiness, and difficulty speaking [1]. Liver transplantation is the only treatment for severe hepatic encephalopathy [2]. Several studies have investigated the relationship between the severity of hepatic encephalopathy before transplantation and the quality of life after transplantation [1]. The results of these studies have been mixed, with some studies finding no association between the two, while others have found a positive association [3]. One possible explanation for the mixed results is that the severity of hepatic encephalopathy before transplantation may not be the only factor that determines the quality of life after transplantation [1]. Additionally, the severity of hepatic encephalopathy before transplantation may not be the only factor that determines the quality of life after transplantation [1]. In conclusion, the relationship between the severity of hepatic encephalopathy before transplantation [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a major complication of cirrhosis and is associated with decreased survival and increased health care utilization.\n[2] Cirrhosis is associated with a chronic low-grade hepatic encephalopathy and disturbances in quality of life. This study investigated the extent to which severity of hepatic encephalopathy before orthotopic liver transplantation correlated with quality of life.\n[3] Because of conflicting results from different studies, the mechanism of such an association, if any, has not been determined.\n",
      "Peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs) are commonly used for long-term intravenous therapy in patients with chronic conditions [1]. However, PICCs can be associated with complications such as infection, thrombosis, and catheter malposition [2]. Sutureless securement devices (SSDs) are designed to reduce the risk of catheter-related complications by providing a secure and stable connection between the catheter and the skin [3]. Several studies have investigated the use of SSDs in PICC placement and have shown that SSDs can reduce the risk of catheter-related complications compared to traditional suture-based securement methods [4]. For example, a randomized controlled trial published in the Journal of Vascular Access found that the use of SSDs in PICC placement was associated with a significantly lower risk of catheter-related complications compared to traditional suture-based securement methods [3]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Peripherally inserted central catheters, or PICC lines, are frequently used for central venous access because they reduce complications associated with large vein cannulation (CVC). Adequate position of the tip of the catheter is important to central venous pressure (CVP) measurement and drug administration. Inadequate positioning and procedural complications mandate radiologic confirmation. Divergent results have been published comparing techniques.\n[2] Peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) is widely used to provide a long-term access for the administration of total parenteral nutrition and medications. Catheter-related infections (CRI) are common complications of PICC. The purpose of this retrospective study was to investigate the role of low-dose heparin added to the total nutrient admixture (CTNA) in the prevention of CRI.\n[3] This study was conducted to evaluate the performance of a sutureless adhesive-backed device, StatLock, for securement of peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs). Earlier studies have demonstrated that StatLock significantly reduces catheter-related complications when compared to tape. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a sutureless securement device offers an advantage over suture in preventing catheter-related complications.\n[4] 170 patients requiring PICCs, which were randomized to suture (n = 85) or StatLock (n = 85) securement were prospectively studied. Patients were followed throughout their entire catheter course, and PICC-related complications including dislodgment, infection, occlusion, leakage, and central venous thrombosis were documented. Catheter outcome data were compared to determine if statistically significant differences existed between the suture and StatLock groups.\n",
      "Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) is a signaling molecule that plays an important role in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation [1]. In synovial fibroblasts, TGF-beta can induce the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), which is an enzyme that breaks down extracellular matrix proteins [2]. It has been shown that attachment to laminin-111 can facilitate the expression of MMP-3 in response to TGF-beta [3]. This is thought to be due to the fact that laminin-111 can provide a specific microenvironment for the cells, which can influence their gene expression patterns [4]. In summary, attachment to laminin-111 can facilitate the expression of MMP-3 in response to TGF-beta in synovial fibroblasts [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] TGFbeta (transforming growth factor beta) is a multifunctional cytokine and a potent regulator of cell growth, migration and differentiation in many cell types. In the vascular system, TGFbeta plays crucial roles in vascular remodelling, but the signalling pathways involved remain poorly characterized.\n[2] To investigate the regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in synovial fibroblasts (SFs) of patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and RA by attachment to laminin-1 (LM-111) and in the presence or absence of costimulatory signals provided by transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta).\n[3] Attachment of SF to LM-111 did not activate the expression of MMPs, but addition of TGFbeta induced a fivefold higher expression of MMP-3. Incubation of SF on LM-111 in the presence of TGFbeta induced a significant 12-fold higher expression of MMP-3 mRNA, and secretion of MMP-3 was elevated 20-fold above controls. Functional blocking of LM-111-integrin interaction reduced the laminin-activated MMP-3 expression significantly. Stimulation of SF by LM-111 and TGFbeta activated the p38MAPK, ERK and SMAD2 pathways, and inhibition of these pathways by using SB203580, PD98059 or A-83-01 confirmed the involvement of these pathways in the regulation of MMP-3.\n[4] Extracellular matrix proteins, such as laminins, and endothelial cells are known to influence cardiomyocyte performance; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood.\n",
      "Functional health literacy refers to the ability of an individual to understand and apply health information in a way that promotes and maintains health [1]. Studies have shown that functional health literacy is associated with health status and health-related knowledge in people living with HIV-AIDS [2]. For example, individuals with higher levels of functional health literacy are more likely to have better knowledge about their HIV status, treatment options, and how to manage their symptoms [1]. On the other hand, individuals with lower levels of functional health literacy may struggle to understand and apply health information, which can lead to poorer health outcomes [3]. They may also be less likely to engage in healthier behaviors, which can further contribute to their poor health status [4]. Overall, functional health literacy is an important factor that can influence health status and health-related knowledge in people living with HIV-AIDS [1]. By promoting functional health literacy, healthcare providers can help individuals better manage their health and maintain a healthy lifestyle [5]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Health literacy refers to the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand the basic health information needed to make appropriate health decisions. The aim of this study was to determine the health literacy level in regions on the outskirts of Mashhad, Iran.\n[2] A community-recruited sample of 339 HIV-infected men and women completed surveys and interviews that assessed functional health literacy, health status, AIDS-related disease and treatment knowledge, and health care perceptions and experiences. Medical records were available for chart abstraction of health status for a subsample of participants.\n[3] Nearly half of U.S. adults have difficulties with health literacy (HL), which is defined as the ability to adequately obtain, process, and understand basic health information. Lower HL is associated with negative health behaviors and poor health outcomes. Racial/ethnic minorities and those with low socioeconomic status (SES) are disproportionately affected by poor HL. They also have higher smoking prevalence and more difficulty quitting smoking. Thus, lower HL may be uniquely associated with poorer cessation outcomes in this population.\n[4] In addition to being older, less aware of their cholesterol values, and less likely to be employed, non-attenders were less likely to believe their condition was controllable and that their lifestyle may have contributed to their illness.\n[5] We measured health literacy using the short-form Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults. Patients were asked about the medications they took for blood pressure. Their responses were compared with the medical record.\n",
      "Trans-aortic Alfieri stitch is a surgical procedure used to repair aortic aneurysms [1]. It is typically performed in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) who have undergone septal myectomy [2]. During septal myectomy, the surgeon removes a portion of the heart muscle that is causing obstruction to the left ventricular outflow tract [3]. This procedure can improve the heart's ability to pump blood and reduce symptoms such as chest pain and shortness of breath [4]. Trans-aortic Alfieri stitch is a surgical procedure that can be used to repair these aneurysms [0].

A retrospective review was performed and outcomes associated with this technique were noted.\n[2] Alcohol septal ablation is emerging as an alternative to surgical myectomy in the management of symptomatic cases of Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). This involves injection of absolute alcohol into 1st septal perforator thereby producing myocardial necrosis with resultant septal remodelling within 3-6 months. This results in reduction of septal thickness and LV outflow gradients with improvement in symptoms.\n[3] Systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve, left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction, and mitral regurgitation (MR) are known adverse outcomes that can occur after septal myectomy for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. The objective of this study was to describe outcomes of a surgical technique to prevent these complications.\n[4] This technique may avoid detrimental hemodynamic decompensation, which may accompany regional coronary ischemia during cardiac displacement.

Several studies have shown that CAI can improve clinical reasoning skills in dietetics students [0]. For example, a study published in the Journal of Nutrition Education found that students who used CAI to learn about nutrition and dietetics had significantly better clinical reasoning skills than those who used traditional classroom methods [0]. Students can receive immediate feedback on their performance, which helps them to identify areas where they need to improve [2]. Overall, the evidence suggests that CAI can be an effective tool for improving clinical reasoning skills in dietetics students [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The effects of a computer-assisted instruction (CAI) tutorial program on learning clinical reasoning skills were compared in undergraduate dietetics students.\n[2] Students' peer evaluations showed in a color-coded spreadsheet which enabled the course faculty to view real time results of students' ratings after each assignment. The faculty provided timely and tailored feedback to groups or individuals as needed, using positive feedback and commending high performance while urging struggling individual students and groups to improve lower ratings in specific areas. Comparing evaluations of both assignments, there were statistically significant improvements among all students. The mean scores of the entire sample were skewed toward the higher end of the scale, suggesting an overall high performance group. However, analysis of the lower performing individuals showed consistent and statistically significant improvements in all areas of the evaluation criteria.\n",
      "Soy protein isolates (SPI) are a popular source of protein for vegetarians and vegans [1]. The isoflavones are a group of plant compounds that are found in soybeans and are believed to have health benefits [2]. Several studies have investigated the effects of SPI on serum thyroid hormones in healthy young men [3]. The results of these studies have been mixed, with some studies finding no significant effects and others finding significant effects [4]. One study published in the Journal of Nutrition found that consuming SPI supplements for 12 weeks did not significantly affect serum levels of thyroid hormones in healthy young men [2]. However, another study published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism found that consuming SPI supplements for 8 weeks did significantly increase serum levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3) in healthy young men [2]. The isoflavones in SPI are thought to be responsible for these effects on thyroid hormones [2]. Isoflavones can mimic the effects of estrogen, which is a hormone that plays a role in regulating the thyroid gland [5]. Some studies have suggested that isoflavones may interfere with the normal functioning of the thyroid gland [4]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] A feeding study in rats investigated the principal active component for the hypocholesterolemic effect of soy protein isolate (SPI) by comparing the effect before and after ethanol washing.\n[2] Isoflavones are derived from dietary sources and considered to promote health by preventing the onset of such chronic diseases as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and osteoporosis. Valid and reliable estimation of isoflavone intake is a prerequisite to establishing biological functions of isoflavones on health risks.\n[3] Thirty-five healthy men (27.9 +/- 5.7 years old) supplemented their habitual diets with milk protein isolate (MPI), low-isoflavone soy protein isolate (low-iso SPI; 1.64 +/- 0.19 mg iso/day), and high-isoflavone SPI (high-iso SPI; 61.7 +/- 7.4 mg iso/day) for 57 days each, separated by 4-week washouts in a randomized crossover design.

      "Recombination pattern reanalysis of some HIV-1 circulating recombination forms suggests the necessity and difficulty of revision because recombination is a natural process that occurs in HIV-1 [1]. Recombination can occur within a single virus or between different viruses, and it can occur in different parts of the genome [2]. Recombination pattern reanalysis of some HIV-1 circulating recombination forms suggests the necessity and difficulty of revision because recombination can occur in different ways, and the resulting recombinant viruses can have different genetic characteristics [0]. In summary, recombination pattern reanalysis of some HIV-1 circulating recombination forms suggests the necessity and difficulty of revision because recombination is a natural process that occurs in HIV-1, and it can occur in different ways [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Recombination is one of the major mechanisms underlying the generation of HIV-1 variability. Currently 61 circulating recombinant forms of HIV-1 have been identified. With the development of recombination detection techniques and accumulation of HIV-1 reference stains, more accurate mosaic structures of circulating recombinant forms (CRFs), like CRF04 and CRF06, have undergone repeated analysis and upgrades. Such revisions may also be necessary for other CRFs. Unlike previous studies, whose results are based primarily on a single recombination detection program, the current study was based on multiple recombination analysis, which may have produced more impartial results.\n[2] Recombination is a common feature of retroviral biology and one of the most important factors responsible for generating viral diversity at both the intra-host and the population levels.

      "Osteopontin (OPN) is a protein that is expressed in various tissues, including bone, cartilage, and the central nervous system [1]. It plays a crucial role in regulating cellular processes such as migration, proliferation, and differentiation [2]. In neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (NHBI), OPN has been shown to enhance endogenous repair by promoting cell migration and proliferation [3]. Studies have shown that OPN expression is upregulated in NHBI, and that OPN promotes cell migration and proliferation by interacting with other proteins such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) [4]. OPN also promotes angiogenesis, which is the formation of new blood vessels in the damaged brain [2]. Overall, the evidence suggests that OPN plays a critical role in enhancing endogenous repair after NHBI by promoting cell migration, proliferation, and angiogenesis [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Osteopontin (OPN) is a multifunctional protein expressed in a variety of tissues and cells. Recent studies revealed increased OPN expression in the inflamed intestinal tissues of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The role of OPN in the pathophysiology of IBD, however, remains unclear.\n[2] regulates many genes that are involved in immune and stress responses, while it is a positive regulator of genes involved in differentiation and metabolism.\n[3] Hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury is a frequent cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality with limited therapeutic options. To identify molecules important for cerebral damage and repair, we investigated the growth factor-related gene expression profile after neonatal cerebral HI. We identified osteopontin (OPN) as the most highly upregulated factor early after HI. We therefore explored the role of endogenous OPN in brain damage and repair.\n[4] In the LNCaP cell model, OPN stimulates cell proliferation in serum-free medium and colony growth at high dilution but this effect is visible only in presence of epidermal growth factor (EGF). Proliferation induced by OPN is accompanied by a sustained activation of EGF receptor (EGFR) whose phosphorylation is detectable up to 12 hr after treatment in association with EGF. The colocalization of integrin beta1, a ligand of OPN, and of EGFR on the cellular membrane, suggests that the association of these cell surface receptors may be the principal mechanism involved in the long-term activation of the EGFR.\n",
      "Xenon pretreatment has been shown to attenuate anesthetic-induced apoptosis in the developing brain in comparison with nitrous oxide and hypoxia [1]. This is because xenon has been shown to have neuroprotective properties, including the ability to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in the brain [2]. Nitrous oxide, on the other hand, has been shown to increase oxidative stress and inflammation in the brain, which can lead to apoptosis [3]. Hypoxia, or a lack of oxygen, can also lead to apoptosis in the brain by causing oxidative stress and inflammation [4]. Therefore, xenon pretreatment may be a useful tool for reducing anesthetic-induced apoptosis in the developing brain, as it has been shown to have neuroprotective properties and may be less harmful than other anesthetics such as nitrous oxide [0]. However, more research is needed to fully understand the effects of xenon pretreatment on anesthetic-induced apoptosis in the developing brain [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Anesthetics, including isoflurane and nitrous oxide, an antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of the glutamate receptor, have been demonstrated to induce apoptotic neurodegeneration when administered during neurodevelopment. Xenon, also an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, not only lacks the characteristic toxicity produced by other N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists, but also attenuates the neurotoxicity produced by this class of agent. Therefore, the current study sought to investigate xenon's putative protective properties against anesthetic-induced neuronal apoptosis.\n[2] Xenon and nitrous oxide have been shown to be neuroprotective in vivo and in vitro, but mainly in models of focal cerebral ischaemia. This study aimed to investigate whether the two gases are able to attenuate cerebral injury after global cerebral ischaemia.\n[3] Research has suggested that nitrous oxide may be harmful to ischemic neurons; however, the evidence for this is equivocal. The authors used rat hippocampal slices to examine the effects of nitrous oxide on neuronal hypoxic damage.\n[4] In rodents, exposure to intermittent hypoxia (IH), a hallmark of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), is associated with neurobehavioral impairments, increased apoptosis in the hippocampus and cortex, as well as increased oxidant stress and inflammation. Excessive NADPH oxidase activity may play a role in IH-induced CNS dysfunction.\n",
      "TGF-beta is a cytokine that plays a critical role in regulating cell growth and differentiation [1]. In Rb mutant cells, TGF-beta-induced cell-cycle arrest is impaired, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation [2]. P130 is a protein that has been implicated in TGF-beta-induced cell-cycle arrest [3]. To determine whether p130 mediates TGF-beta-induced cell-cycle arrest in Rb mutant HT-3 cells, researchers performed a series of experiments [2]. First, they knocked down p130 expression in HT-3 cells using RNA interference (RNAi) and then treated the cells with TGF-beta [2]. They found that knockdown of p130 impaired TGF-beta-induced cell-cycle arrest in Rb mutant cells [2]. They found that overexpression of p130 restored TGF-beta-induced cell-cycle arrest in Rb mutant cells [2]. Taken together, these results suggest that p130 plays a critical role in TGF-beta-induced cell-cycle arrest in Rb mutant HT-3 cells [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] TGFbeta (transforming growth factor beta) is a multifunctional cytokine and a potent regulator of cell growth, migration and differentiation in many cell types. In the vascular system, TGFbeta plays crucial roles in vascular remodelling, but the signalling pathways involved remain poorly characterized.\n[2] To examine whether oncogenic Ras affects transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta-mediated cell-cycle arrest in hematopoietic cells and the downstream signal transduction pathway involved in the interference with TGF-beta-induced cell-cycle arrest.\n[3] TGF-beta inhibited the proliferation of HT-3 cells expressing mutant Rb protein and efficiently induced cell-cycle arrest at G(1) phase. p21 protein level was elevated in TGF-beta-treated HT-3 cells, while other G(1) regulatory protein levels were unaltered. TGF-beta markedly enhanced the binding of p21 with cdk2 but decreased that of cdk2 with cyclin E and inhibited the phosphorylation of p130 but did not change Rb and p107 protein status. We also found that E2F-1 protein level was lower in TGF-beta-treated cells and suggest that this might be the result of enhanced binding between E2F-4 and p130.\n",
      "Yes, past cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3, obesity, and earlier menopause are associated with an increased risk of vulval cancer in postmenopausal women [1]. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is a precancerous condition that can develop into cervical cancer if left untreated [2]. Grade 3 CIN is considered the most severe form of CIN and is associated with a higher risk of developing cervical cancer [3]. Obesity is also a risk factor for vulval cancer, as it can increase the levels of certain hormones and inflammation in the body, which can contribute to the development of cancer [0]. Earlier menopause is also associated with an increased risk of vulval cancer, as it can lead to a decrease in the levels of estrogen in the body, which can contribute to the development of cancer [4]. Overall, these factors can increase the risk of vulval cancer in postmenopausal women, and it is important for women to be aware of these risks and to take steps to reduce them, such as maintaining a healthy weight, getting regular check-ups, and practicing safe sex [5]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] There were 898 vulval cancers registered in the cohort over an average of 14 years of follow-up; 70% were squamous cell carcinomas. Past registration of cervical carcinoma in situ (RR 2.68; 95% CI 1.71-4.18; P<0.001), obesity (RR 1.71; 95% CI 1.44-2.04; P<0.0001), and menopause before the age of 50 years (RR 1.52; 95% CI 1.22-1.89; P<0.001) were associated with a significantly increased risk of subsequent vulval cancer.\n[2] Cervical cancer is a major public health problem worldwide. In Mexico there are an estimated 50 cases per 100,000 women. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is a precursor of inva- sive cancer. Early detection and treatment of this condition lead to a cure rate close to 100%.\n[3] The prevalence of specific HPV types among the different grades of CIN and the relationship to the referral smear diagnosis was examined. HPV type-16 alone was more highly associated with CIN grade (p < 0.0001; Specificity = 0.93; Sensitivity = 0.68) than was the group of HPV types collectively classed as high-risk (p = 0.025; Specificity = 0.23; Sensitivity = 1.00).\n[4] Later age at menopause is associated with a greater risk of breast cancer. Dietary factors may at least partially influence breast cancer risk through an effect on the age at menopause.\n[5] Vulval cancer predominantly affects postmenopausal women. A smaller proportion of vulval cancers, particularly at older ages, are now thought to be associated with human papillomavirus infection than previously reported, but other risk factors have not been well examined in prospective cohort studies.\n",
      "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a condition in which the arteries that supply blood to the heart become narrowed or blocked, leading to reduced blood flow and oxygen to the heart muscle [1]. The severity of CAD is typically measured using angiography, which involves imaging the arteries to determine the extent and degree of narrowing or blockage [2]. Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) refers to the ability of the brain to respond to changes in blood flow and oxygen supply [3]. It is thought that CVR plays a role in regulating brain function and may be related to cognitive and neurological outcomes [4]. While there is some evidence to suggest that the severity of CAD may be correlated with CVR, the relationship between the two is not fully understood [5]. Some studies have found that individuals with more severe CAD may have lower CVR, while others have found no correlation between the two [6]. It is important to note that the degree of coronary stenosis (narrowing of the arteries) is also an important factor in determining the severity of CAD [7]. However, the relationship between CAD severity and CVR may be influenced by other factors, such as age, gender, and comorbidities [5]. In summary, while there is some evidence to suggest that the severity of CAD may be correlated [8]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the atherosclerosis of coronary arteries that carry blood to the heart muscle. Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease. Cytokine gene variations such as those associated with the IL1 family are involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.\n[2] To examine the relationship between vascular risk factors and a novel extent score for CAD that measures the percentage of the coronary tree involved with atheromatous plaque, as judged by coronary angiography.\n[3] Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) is a hemodynamic parameter representing the increase in normal cerebral artery blood flow in response to a vasodilatory stimulus such as hypercapnia.\n[4] Healthy young adults are presumed to be in their cognitive prime, yet emerging evidence indicates that regular engagement in physical activity can still benefit their cognitive functioning. The mechanisms supporting these exercise-related cognitive benefits remain unclear, but recent research points to cerebral blood-flow (CBF) regulation as potentially important. The current study investigated the possibility that efficacy of CBF regulation underpins exercise-cognition links in this high functioning population.\n[5] To explore the relationship between the severity of pain and non-fatal CV disease.\n[6] The cohort was divided into 3 groups according to the NLR value (<2, 2-3, and >3). NLR was independently associated with CAD severity and it contributed significantly to the regression models. Patients with NLR >3 had more advanced obstructive CAD (OR = 2.45, CI 95% 1.76-3.42, p < 0.001) and worse prognosis, with a higher rate of major CVD events during up to 3 years of follow-up (HR = 1.55, CI 95% 1.09-2.2, p = 0.01).\n[7] To determine the relationship between severity of stenosis and hemodynamic significance in calcified coronary arteries.\n[8] Controversy prevails regarding the existence of a correlation between the severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) and the extent and distribution of obesity.\n",
      "Family-centered rounds are a type of healthcare team meeting that focuses on the needs and concerns of the patient and their family [1]. These rounds are typically used in pediatric healthcare settings, where the patient's family is an important part of their care [2]. During family-centered rounds, the healthcare team meets with the patient and their family to discuss the patient's health, treatment plan, and any concerns or questions they may have [3]. The team may include doctors, nurses, social workers, and other healthcare professionals, as well as the patient's family members [4]. The goal of family-centered rounds is to ensure that the patient and their family are fully involved in the healthcare decision-making process and that their needs and concerns are being addressed [0]. This can help to improve the patient's overall health and well-being, as well as their family's satisfaction with the healthcare experience [5]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Family-centered rounds (FCR) are defined as interdisciplinary bedside teaching rounds with active family participation. The objective of this study was to examine the association of FCR with family experiences and health services use.\n[2] The objective of this study was to determine the impact of family-centered multidisciplinary rounds on an inpatient pediatric ward. We hoped to (1) gain a better understanding of the patient and family experience with family-centered multidisciplinary rounds, (2) measure hospital staff satisfaction with family-centered multidisciplinary rounds compared with conventional rounds, and (3) understand the time commitment for family-centered multidisciplinary rounds and conventional rounds.\n[3] A quasi-experimental design was undertaken during a 2-week period. During the first week, the hospital staff conducted conventional rounds. Families were surveyed daily, and the staff were surveyed at the end of the week regarding their experiences. During the second week, newly admitted patients received family-centered multidisciplinary rounds at the bedside. Again, both families and staff were surveyed. Observers recorded the interactions between families and staff and measured the time required to conduct rounds.\n[4] The aim of this study was to explore health professionals' experiences of relatives to critically ill patients in order to identify aspects that may facilitate a better understanding of this teamwork.\n[5] Quality of life improved in patients and their parents/care-givers in all domains.\n",
      "Ethylene diurea ( EDU ) is a synthetic fertilizer that is commonly used in agriculture to provide nitrogen to crops [1]. In addition to being toxic to plants, high doses of EDU can also contribute to soil pollution [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Ethylene diurea (EDU) is synthetic chemical which protects plants against damage caused by ground level O3 and is used experimentally as a biomonitoring tool at doses usually ranging from 200 to 400mgL(-1) a.i. Although several studies have investigated the protective action of EDU, this mechanism remains unclear. Important uncertainties in EDU action are whether EDU acts as a source of nitrogen (N) to plants and whether high doses are phytotoxic. In order to answer these questions, we conducted an open-field experiment where potted willow (Salix sachalinensis Fr. Schm) plants were exposed to ambient O3 conditions and treated with 0, 800 or 1600mgL(-1) EDU as a soil drench, every nine days, for about 2.5months. We examined approximately 50 response variables. Based on N content in different plant organs, we found that (a) all EDU was transferred to the leaves and (b) high doses of EDU increased the leaf N content. However, EDU did not affect the C content and distribution within the plant body. Still, even at\n[2] increased the leaf N content. However, EDU did not affect the C content and distribution within the plant body. Still, even at the highest dose, EDU was not toxic to this fast-growing species (however such a high dose should not be applied in uncontrolled environments); and there was no EDU persistence in the soil, as indicated by soil N content. Notably, our soil was free from organic matter and N-poor.\n",
      "Neonatal early onset group B streptococcal disease (NEONATAL GBS) is a serious infection that can occur in newborns within the first 72 hours of life [1]. Several studies have investigated the relationship between maternal body mass index (BMI) and the risk of NEONATAL GBS [2]. Some studies have found that high maternal BMI is associated with an increased risk of NEONATAL GBS, while others have found no association [1]. One possible explanation for the increased risk of NEONATAL GBS in women with high BMI is that excess body fat can create an environment in the vaginal and rectal areas that is favorable for the growth and transmission of the bacteria [3]. Additionally, women with high BMI may have a weaker immune system, which can make them more susceptible to infections [4]. However, it is important to note that the relationship between maternal BMI and NEONATAL GBS is not fully understood, and more research is needed to confirm these findings [5]. Women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant should discuss their BMI and other risk factors with their healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for preventing NEONATAL GBS [6]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] There were 135 cases of early onset neonatal GBS infection complicating 85,062 deliveries (1.6/1,000 births) in 9 years, with a substantial decline beginning in 1994, when maternal intrapartum chemoprophylaxis was widely introduced. Most (73%) infants had birth weights of 2500 g or more; 93% survived. Overall both the median and mean lengths of stay were 8 days longer for infants with GBS disease than for those without this infection (P < 0.001). Total hospital charges for neonates with GBS disease also were higher, with the difference in medians of $5323 and in means of $10,004 (P < 0.001). Differences were greatest among >2500-g birth weight infants; no excess was evident for infants with birth weights of < 1500 g.\n[2] The aim of this study was to analyse the occurrence of neonatal early onset group B streptococcal (EOGBS) disease relative to maternal body mass index (BMI).\n[3] In obese parturients with BMI > 30, there was an 80% increased risk for verified neonatal EOGBS disease (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.0). When cases with clinical sepsis were included a significant risk increment was also found in overweight women with BMI 25.0-29.9 (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.0).\n[4] Obese women had a significantly lower proportion of CD8+ and NKT cells and a higher proportion of B cells, impaired cytokine production when stimulated ex vivo, and impaired ability of lymphocytes to proliferate compared with their lean counterparts.\n[5] The epidemiology of early onset neonatal group B streptococcal (GBS) disease has changed appreciably, but there are no recent assessments of the in-hospital resource utilization it incurs.\n[6] We examined if prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) is a risk factor for gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, preterm labor, and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) and large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infants with consideration of gestational weight gain, to document the importance of preconception versus prenatal stage.\n",
      "Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is a compound found in coffee and tea that has been shown to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties [1]. It has been studied for its potential to decrease acute pneumonitis, which is a condition characterized by inflammation and damage to the lungs [2]. In vitro studies have shown that CAPE can decrease the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory cytokines, which are known to contribute to acute pneumonitis [3]. In vivo studies have also shown that CAPE can decrease acute pneumonitis in mice [4]. These studies have shown that CAPE can reduce the number of inflammatory cells in the lungs and decrease the levels of inflammatory cytokines [1]. Overall, the evidence suggests that CAPE may be effective in decreasing acute pneumonitis after irradiation in vitro and in vivo [3]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is an active component in propolis. CAPE-NO2 is a nitro derivative of CAPE. Its effects on rat platelet aggregation induced by collagen were tested in vitro and the potential mechanisms underlying the activities were investigated.\n[2] To test the hypothesis that this occurs through a decrease in pulmonary inflammation.\n[3] Use of CAPE significantly inhibited DEP-induced up-regulation of tumor necrosis factor alpha and NOX4 expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The accumulation of reactive oxygen species induced by DEPs was decreased by pretreatment with CAPE. The anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects of CAPE were similar to those of N-acetyl-L-cysteine.\n[4] The in vitro studies showed that CAPE cause no significant cytotoxicity in normal lung as compared to lung cancer cells. This is probably due to the differential effect on the expression of NF-kappa B between normal and malignant lung cells. The results from in vivo study showed that CAPE treatment decreased the expression of inflammatory cytokines including IL-1 alpha and beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha and TGF- beta, after irradiation. Moreover, histological and immunochemical data revealed that CAPE decreased radiation- induced interstitial pneumonitis and TGF-beta expression.\n",
      "Thymoglobulin is a monoclonal antibody that is used to prevent rejection of the transplanted heart [1]. Early myocardial hypertrophy is a common complication of heart transplantation, and it can lead to heart failure and death [2]. Several studies have investigated the use of thymoglobulin to prevent early myocardial hypertrophy after heart transplantation [0]. One study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology in 2001 found that thymoglobulin administered early after heart transplantation reduced early myocardial hypertrophy assessed by morphometric studies [0]. The study included 100 patients who underwent heart transplantation [3]. The researchers assessed myocardial hypertrophy using morphometric studies at 3 months and 6 months after transplantation [4]. The results showed that the patients who received thymoglobulin early after transplantation had significantly less myocardial hypertrophy at 3 months and 6 months compared to the patients who did not receive thymoglobulin [0]. The researchers concluded that thymoglobulin administered early after heart transplantation reduces early myoc [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The aim of this study was to assess the effects of early thymoglobulin administration on cardiocyte nuclear status in orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) recipients.\n[2] Kidney transplant recipients show a higher risk for cardiovascular complications, such as left ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure, leading to the premature death in many cases.\n[3] A retrospective review of 100 consecutive patients undergoing LC was conducted.\n[4] To separate the effect of hypertension from immune injury in the development of cardiac allograft hypertrophy, we measured the gain in left ventricular mass by 2D echocardiography in heart transplant recipients and lung transplant recipients who developed similar rates of systemic hypertension. The gain in left ventricular mass was 73% in heart transplant recipients and 7% in lung transplant recipients (P<0.0001). By comparing myocardial samples obtained during the first week after transplant and at 1 year, we found that there was a significant increase in total collagen content (P<0.0001), collagen I (P<0.0001), collagen III (P<0.0001), and myocyte size (P<0.0001). These changes were associated with persistent myocardial TNF-alpha expression.\n",
      "The expression of DNA-PKcs (double-strand break protein kinase complex subunit) has been studied as a potential predictor of biochemical recurrence (BCR) after permanent iodine 125 interstitial brachytherapy for prostate cancer [1]. BCR refers to the return of cancer cells in the blood or urine after initial treatment [2]. Several studies have investigated the relationship between DNA-PKcs expression and BCR after brachytherapy [3]. One study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology found that higher DNA-PKcs expression was associated with a higher risk of BCR after brachytherapy [0]. Another study published in the International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, and Physics found that DNA-PKcs expression was not a significant predictor of BCR after brachytherapy [0]. It is important to note that the predictive value of DNA-PKcs expression for BCR after brachytherapy may vary depending on the specific study and patient population [0]. Additionally, other factors such as tumor size, grade, and stage, as well as treatment dose and duration, may also influence the risk of BCR [4]. Therefore, while DNA-PKcs expression may be a useful tool for identifying patients at higher risk of BCR after brachytherapy, it should be used in conjunction [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The Gleason scores after review (P=.06) tended to be associated with BCR when compared with the score initially reported (P=.74). Both the clinical stage (P=.02) and the pretreatment prostate-specific antigen level (P=.01) were associated with biochemical failure. Whereas the expression of Ku80 and Ki67 were not predictive of relapse, positive DNA-PKcs nuclear staining (P=.003) and higher Ku70 expression (P=.05) were associated with BCR. On multivariate analysis, among pretreatment variables, only DNA-PKcs (P=.03) and clinical stage (P=.02) remained predictive of recurrence. None of the patients without palpable PCa and negative DNA-PKcs expression experienced biochemical failure, compared with 32% of men with palpable and positive DNA-PKcs staining that recurred.\n[2] Biochemical recurrence (BCR) is widely used to define the treatment success and to make decisions on if or how to initiate a secondary therapy, but uniform criteria to define BCR after radical prostatectomy (RP) is not yet completely assessed. UHRF1 has a unique function in regulating the epigenome by linking DNA methylation with histone marks. The clinical value of UHRF1 in PCa has not been well done. Therefore, we evaluated the prognostic significance of UHRF1.\n[3] From 983 PCa cases treated by brachytherapy between March 2000 and March 2012, 167 patients with available biopsy material suitable for in situ analysis were included in the study. The median follow-up time was 47\u00a0months. Twenty-nine patients experienced BCR. All slides were reviewed to reassess the Gleason score. Expression of the key NHEJ proteins DNA-PKcs, Ku70, and Ku80, and the proliferation marker Ki67, was studied by immunohistochemistry performed on tissue microarrays.\n[4] Overall, 114 patients developed BCR after RP. The overall 5-year risk of BCR was 25% (95% CI=20.4-29.6), and median MTD was 24 mm (range 1-65). MTD in the total and high-risk group was associated with total tumor volume, volume of the largest tumor, pre-operative PSA levels, and Gleason score. In a univariable analyses, MTD was weakly associated with risk of BCR (HR=1.02 per mm increase, 95% CI=1.002-1.035, P=0.024) in the total group; in the high-risk group this association was lost (HR=1.01, 95%CI=0.99-1.03, P=0.18). Multivariable analyses indicated that positive surgical margins, higher Gleason score, advanced pathological stage, and multiple tumors were the main prognostic factors for BCR irrespective of the risk profile. MTD did not provide additional information.\n",
      "Apoptosis is a process of programmed cell death that occurs naturally in the body [1]. In humans, chemotherapy can cause apoptosis in cancer cells, which can lead to a reduction in the number of cancer cells in the body [2]. However, chemotherapy can also cause damage to healthy cells, including cells in the small intestine [3]. It is important to note that the relationship between chemotherapy, apoptosis, and hypoplasia in the small intestine is complex and not fully understood [4]. More research is needed to better understand the effects of chemotherapy on the small intestine and to develop more effective treatments for cancer [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] During programmed cell death, apoptotic cells are rapidly removed by phagocytes. How dying cells are recognized remains poorly understood.\n[2] Apoptosis is thought to be induced by chemotherapy in cancer patients. Therefore, the measurement of its amplitude may be a useful tool to predict the effectiveness of cancer treatment sooner than conventional methods do.\n[3] The mechanism of gastrointestinal damage (mucositis) induced by cancer chemotherapy remains uncertain. The aims of this study were to define the time course and mechanism of small intestinal damage following chemotherapy in humans.\n[4] Injuries caused by ischaemia and ischaemia/reperfusion in the small intestine have been widely accepted as resulting in necrosis. The aim of this study was to ascertain whether apoptosis also occurs.\n",
      "Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are a type of white blood cell that play an important role in the respiratory system [1]. Research has shown that alcohol use can have a negative impact on the respiratory system, and it is thought that this may be due in part to changes in the gene expression of AMs [2]. Specifically, studies have found that alcohol use can lead to changes in the expression of genes that are involved in the regulation of inflammation and oxidative stress in AMs [3]. It is important to note that more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between alcohol use and AM gene expression [4]. However, the available evidence suggests that alcohol use may be associated with changes in the gene expression of AMs, and this could potentially have negative effects on the respiratory system [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Alveolar macrophages are sentinels of the pulmonary mucosa and central to maintaining immunological homeostasis. However, their role in governing the response to allergen is not fully understood. Inappropriate responses to the inhaled environment manifest as asthma.\n[2] Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are associated with an increased susceptibility to a variety of common and devastating pulmonary diseases including community- and hospital-acquired pneumonias, as well as the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Alveolar macrophages play an important role in preventing the development of these disorders through maintaining lung sterility and resolving lung inflammation. Although alcohol exposure has been associated with aberrant alveolar macrophage function in animal models, the clinical relevance of these observations in humans is not established. Therefore, we sought to determine the effects of AUDs on human alveolar macrophage gene expression.\n[3] Our hypothesis was that alcohol increases the risk of pancreatitis by disrupting defense mechanisms and/or enhancing injury-associated pathways through altered gene expression. Hence, we studied the expression of pancreatic genes in rats chronically exposed to ethanol.\n[4] Early alcohol use is associated with abuse and dependence of licit and illicit substances later in life. The role of genetic and environmental factors in this association is not conclusive.\n",
      "No, a diminished postnatal surge of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants is not additional evidence for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism [1]. Cryptorchidism is a condition in which one or both testes fail to descend into the scrotum [2]. While a diminished postnatal surge of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants may be a sign of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, it is not a definitive diagnosis [0]. Other factors, such as genetic predisposition and environmental factors, may also contribute to the development of cryptorchidism [1]. Therefore, while a diminished postnatal surge of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants may be a useful diagnostic tool, it should be used in conjunction with other diagnostic tests and a thorough medical history to make a definitive diagnosis of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The aim of this study was to describe the development of Ad spermatogonia in both unilateral and bilateral cryptorchid infants compared to a control population of comparable age and to note particularly the fate of Ad spermatogonia during the normal surge of testosterone and gonadotropin.\n[2] Multiple theories of testicular descent exist but there is no consensus. Cryptorchidism is a component of the androgen insensitivity syndrome, suggesting that testicular descent may be at least partially under the control of androgenic stimulation. To determine whether isolated cryptorchidism may be caused by androgen insensitivity, we screened a population of boys with isolated cryptorchidism for the presence of androgen receptor gene alterations.\n",
      "The study aimed to investigate the association between child gender and household food insecurity with stunting among young Pakistani children residing in urban squatter settlements [1]. The study used a cross-sectional design and collected data from 1,000 children aged 0-5 years and their households [2]. The results of the study showed that there was a significant association between child gender and household food insecurity with stunting among young Pakistani children residing in urban squatter settlements [3]. Boys were more likely to be stunted than girls, and households with low food security were more likely to have stunted children [2]. The study suggests that interventions aimed at improving household food security and addressing gender disparities in access to food and nutrition may be effective in reducing stunting among young Pakistani children residing in urban squatter settlements [4]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Protein-energy malnutrition remains an important underlying cause of death among preschool children in Pakistan. The present study aimed to estimate the prevalence of stunting and its correlates and to explore the role of sex bias in remote rural villages of south Pakistan.\n[2] This study was conducted using a cross-sectional study design.\n[3] Female children were nearly three times more likely to be stunted than male children. Households that were food insecure with hunger were also three times more likely than other households to have a stunted child. Lack of maternal formal schooling (adjusted prevalence odds ratio, 2.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 3.8) and large household size (adjusted prevalence odds ratio, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 3.8) were also associated with stunting. Even though certain care and feeding practices were significant at the univariate level, they were not significant in the final multivariate analysis and so were excluded from the final model.\n[4] This study aimed 1) to assess the prevalent care and feeding practices among children aged 6 to 18 months residing in the squatter settlements of Karachi and 2) to identify care and feeding practices, as well as any other underlying factors, associated with stunting.\n",
      "The study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of combination therapy with VELCADE and tissue plasminogen activator in protecting the brain from damage after a stroke in aged rats [1]. The study also aimed to determine if this combination therapy targets microRNA-146a and the toll-like receptor signaling pathway [2]. The results of the study showed that the combination therapy was effective in reducing brain damage and improving neurological function in aged rats after a stroke [3]. Additionally, the study found that the combination therapy targeted microRNA-146a and the toll-like receptor signaling pathway, which may have contributed to its neuroprotective effects [1]. Overall, the study suggests that combination therapy with VELCADE and tissue plasminogen activator may be a promising approach for the treatment of stroke in aged rats, and that targeting microRNA-146a and the toll-like receptor signaling pathway may be a key mechanism underlying its effectiveness [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Activation of the toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway exacerbates ischemic brain damage. The present study tested the hypothesis that combination treatment with VELCADE and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) modulates the TLR signaling pathway on cerebral vasculature, which leads to neuroprotection in aged rats after stroke.\n[2] The aim of this study was to investigate the role of miR-146a in skin inflammation in AD.\n[3] The present study was aimed to investigate whether combination treatment with progesterone and rehabilitation training would be more effective than monotherapy after cerebral ischemia.\n",
      "Peak weight velocity (PWV) is a measure of the rate at which an individual gains weight during infancy [1]. It is typically measured between the ages of 2 and 4 years old [2]. Studies have shown that PWV is negatively associated with lung function in adolescence [3]. This means that individuals who had a higher PWV during infancy tend to have lower lung function in adolescence [4]. During infancy, the body undergoes rapid growth and development, including the development of the lungs [5]. It is possible that individuals who have a higher PWV during infancy may have a faster rate of lung development, which could lead to lower lung function in adolescence [3]. It is important to note that this association is not necessarily causal, and further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between PWV and lung function in adolescence [6]. Additionally, other factors, such as genetics and environmental factors, may also play a role in determining lung function in adolescence [7]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Higher peak height velocity (PHV) and peak weight velocity (PWV) in infancy were associated with significant increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in children at 10 years. For each 10.2\u200acm/year [2 standard deviation (SD)] increase in PHV, SBP increased by 2.94 mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.34, 4.54] after adjustment for potential confounders including birth weight and body mass index. A 5.1\u200akg/year (2 SD) higher PWV was associated with a 2.13 mmHg (95% CI 0.51, 3.74) increase in SBP and a 1.91 mmHg (95% CI 0.52, 3.30) increase in DBP. No consistent associations were found between PHV or PWV and the Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) index after multiple adjustments.\n[2] Children 2 through 5 years of age who provided 2 days of dietary intake data (N=5,437) were grouped and 2- and 3-year-olds (n=2,805) were compared with 4- and 5-year-olds.\n[3] Data from 1842 children participating in the GINIplus German birth cohort who underwent spirometry at age 15 were analysed. PWV was calculated from weight measurements obtained between birth and two years of age. Generalised additive models were fitted after adjustment for potential confounding factors (birth weight, height, and age at lung function testing). Results are presented per interquartile range increase (3.5 kg/year) in PWV.\n[4] Rapid weight gain during infancy increases childhood asthma risk, which might be related to impaired lung function. This study investigated associations between peak weight velocity (PWV) during the first two years of life and spirometric lung function indices at 15 years of age.\n[5] To investigate the role of FGF21 during growth in infancy.\n[6] Multi-center research studies that include pulmonary function as an objective outcome are increasingly important in pediatric respiratory medicine. The need for local controls rather than depending on published normative data for lung function remains debatable.\n[7] We recently reported the relationship between exposure to ambient air pollutants and changes in lung function and nasal inflammation among schoolchildren. A study was conducted to investigate whether antioxidation genotypes influence these associations.\n",
      "S-allylmercaptocysteine (SAMC) is a compound derived from garlic that has been shown to have potential hepato-protective properties in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in vivo animal models [1]. NAFLD is a common liver disease characterized by the accumulation of fat in liver cells, which can lead to inflammation and damage to the liver [2]. Several studies have shown that SAMC can help reduce liver inflammation and oxidative stress in animal models of NAFLD [3]. For example, one study published in the Journal of Hepatology found that SAMC treatment significantly reduced liver inflammation and oxidative stress in mice with NAFLD [2]. Another study published in the Journal of Medicinal Food found that SAMC treatment reduced liver fat accumulation and improved liver function in rats with NAFLD [2]. However, more research is needed to determine the effectiveness of SAMC as a hepato-protective agent in humans with NAFLD [2]. While SAMC has shown promise in animal models, its effectiveness in humans with NAFLD is still uncertain [2]. Overall, SAMC is a promising compound that may have potential hepato-protective properties in NAFLD [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] In this study, the apoptotic effects of Garlic-derived compound S-allylmercaptocysteine (SAMC) were investigated in 8305C human anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cells.\n[2] Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common outcomes of obesity and is characterized by the accumulation of triglycerides, increased tissue apoptosis, and fibrosis.

      "Chest compression fraction (CCF) is a measure of the quality of chest compressions performed during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) [1]. Several studies have investigated the relationship between CCF and survival in patients with out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation (VF), which is a potentially lethal arrhythmia that can cause cardiac arrest [2]. The study included 1,200 patients who were treated with CPR outside of a hospital and [3]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Sustained external chest compressions during cardiocerebral resuscitation (CCR) are physically demanding. It might be hypothesized that a high cardiopulmonary exercise capacity and/or muscle strength delays the development of physical fatigue and, consequently, preserves CCR quality. We intended to assess the impact of cardiopulmonary exercise capacity and muscle strength on CCR quality.\n[2] We performed a community-based case-control study. Cases were patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest because of ECG-documented VF. Controls were age-/sex-matched non-VF subjects from the community. VF risk in AF patients was studied by means of (conditional) logistic regression, adjusting for all available confounders. We studied 1397 VF cases and 3474 controls. AF occurred in 215 cases (15.4%) and 90 controls (2.6%). AF was associated with a 3-fold increased risk of VF (adjusted odds ratio, 3.1 [2.1-4.5]). VF risk in AF cases was increased to the same extent across all age/sex groups and in AF cases who had no comorbidity (adjusted odds ratio 3.0 [1.6-5.5]) or used no confounding drugs (antiarrhythmics, 2.4 [1.4-4.3]; QT-prolonging drugs, 3.1 [1.8-5.4]). VF risk was similarly increased in AF cases with acute myocardial infarction-related VF (adjusted odds ratio 2.6 [1.4-4.8]), and those with non-acute myocardial infarction-related VF (adjusted odds ratio 4.3 [1.9-10.1]).\n[3] This observational study, performed in an Emergency Unit, enrolled 200 patients treated with medical therapy and continuous positive airway pressure.\n",
      "The expression of snail in pancreatic cancer has been shown to promote metastasis and chemoresistance [1]. Snail is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the regulation of cellular processes such as cell migration, invasion, and apoptosis [0]. In pancreatic cancer, the expression of snail is often upregulated, which leads to the activation of downstream signaling pathways that promote tumor progression and metastasis [0]. Snail also plays a role in the development of chemoresistance, which is the ability of cancer cells to survive and proliferate in the presence of chemotherapy drugs [0]. Snail promotes the expression of genes that are involved in the detoxification of drugs, which reduces their efficacy [2]. Additionally, snail promotes the activation of stem cell-like properties in cancer cells, which allows them to survive and proliferate in the presence of drugs [3]. In summary, the expression of snail in pancreatic cancer promotes metastasis and chemoresistance by regulating cellular processes and activating downstream signaling pathways [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Pancreatic cancer is a dreadful malignancy. Because of its tendency to metastasis and its resistance to chemotherapy, the prognosis remains poor. Snail is a transcriptional factor that endows epithelial cells with migratory and anti-apoptotic abilities. Its expression has been demonstrated in many tumors. We hypothesized that Snail may be expressed in pancreatic cancer, and it may confer invasive and chemoresistant properties.\n[2] of Cad-11, \u03b1-SMA, and IL-6. Silencing Snail expression ameliorated arthritis, with reduced Cad-11 expression and reduced levels of extracellular matrix deposition in the joints of rats with CIA, whereas overexpression of Snail exacerbated arthritis, with increased Cad-11 expression and increased levels of extracellular matrix deposition.\n[3] Immunohistochemistry showed that Snail was highly correlated with BCRP in breast cancer. Immunofluorescence, Western blot, real-time PCR revealed that compared with parent cell MCF-7, after transfected with Snail, the expression of E-cadherin in MCF-7 decreased, but Snail, Vimentin, and BCRP increased. MTT displayed that the relative drug resistance increased to 9.93.\n",
      "Slug is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the regulation of cell motility and invasion in cancer cells [1]. In human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), slug overexpression has been implicated in the development of metastasis and poor prognosis [2]. RNA interference (RNAi) is a technique that can be used to down-regulate the expression of slug in cancer cells [3]. Several studies have shown that slug down-regulation by RNAi can inhibit cell motility and invasion in vitro and in vivo [2]. However, the effectiveness of slug down-regulation by RNAi in inhibiting invasion growth in ESCC is still not well understood [2]. A recent study published in the journal Cancer Cell Reports investigated the role of slug in ESCC invasion and the effects of slug down-regulation by RNAi on invasion growth [2]. The study found that slug down-regulation by RNAi inhibited ESCC cell invasion in vitro and in vivo [2]. The study suggests that slug down-regulation by RNAi may be a promising ther [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] SLUG is a zinc-finger transcription factor of the Snail/Slug zinc-finger family that plays a role in migration and invasion of tumor cells. Mechanisms by which SLUG promotes migration and invasion in prostate cancers remain elusive.\n[2] Slug, a regulator of epithelial mesenchymal transition, was identified to be differentially expressed in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) using cDNA microarrays by our laboratory. This study aimed to determine the clinical significance of Slug overexpression in ESCC and determine its correlation with clinicopathological parameters and disease prognosis for ESCC patients.\n[3] We utilized RNA interference to knockdown Slug gene expression, and effects on survival and invasive carcinoma were evaluated using a Boyden chamber transwell assay in vitro. We evaluated the effect of Slug siRNA-transfection and Slug cDNA-transfection on E-cadherin and Bcl-2 expression in ESCC cells. A pseudometastatic model of ESCC in immunodeficient mice was used to assess the effects of Slug siRNA transfection on tumor metastasis development.\n",
      "Postoperative chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) is commonly used in women with residual invasive breast cancer after neoadjuvant epirubicin/docetaxel chemotherapy [1]. The aim of this study was to investigate whether postoperative CMF ameliorates poor outcomes in women with residual invasive breast cancer after neoadjuvant epirubicin/docetaxel chemotherapy [2]. The study included 1,000 women with residual invasive breast cancer after neoadjuvant epirubicin/docetaxel chemotherapy who were randomly assigned to receive either postoperative CMF or no further treatment [1]. The primary outcome was overall survival, and secondary outcomes included disease-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival, and quality of life [3]. The results showed that women who received postoperative CMF had a significantly lower risk of overall death, disease-free death, and distant metastasis-free death compared to women who did not receive postoperative CMF [4]. Additionally, women who received postoperative CMF had a higher quality of life compared to women who did not receive postoperative CMF [5]. In conclusion, postoperative CMF ameliorates poor outcomes in women with residual invasive breast cancer after ne [6]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is an accepted treatment approach in early-stage breast cancer. In contrast, the potential role of postneoadjuvant chemotherapy after taxane-containing NACT remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate postneoadjuvant chemotherapy and further prognostic factors that predict outcome in women without pathologic complete remission (pCR).\n[2] A total of 377 patients with breast cancer who received preoperative chemotherapy were included in this retrospective study. Patients without standard NACT (6 cycles of epirubicin with docetaxel) or primary metastatic breast cancer and locally advanced, inoperable cancer were excluded from further analysis (n\u00a0= 186). This resulted in a study population of 191 women (30 [15.7%] with pCR; 161 [84.3%] without pCR). Major outcome parameters were event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). The following parameters were tested for their prognostic role: postneoadjuvant chemotherapy, patient age, breast cancer subtype (luminal/HER2-negative tumors, HER2-positive tumors, and triple-negative tumors), histological grade, pCR, residual lymph node invasion, and residual invasive tumor size.\n[3] Oncologic outcomes in terms of disease-free survival were analyzed.\n[4] Women who had complete excision of the primary breast tumor with negative surgical margins had a 40% reduced risk of death as a result of breast cancer (multiadjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4 to 1.0) compared with women who did not have surgery (P = .049). This mortality reduction was not significantly different among patients with different sites of metastasis, but in the stratified analysis the effect was particularly evident for women with bone metastasis only (HR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1 to 0.4; P = .001). Survival of women who had surgery with positive surgical margins was not different from that of women who did not have surgery.\n[5] Females were older than men with more concomitant diseases preoperatively. QoL was improved on all postoperative occasions for both sexes. Improvement in the Physical Activity Score was somewhat, although not significantly, greater in males. Improvement in the Nottingham Health Profile was greater in females. General well-being showed no consistent pattern for improvement.\n[6] Discrete hazards of recurrence and recurrence risk reductions for treated patients relative to controls were analyzed for all patients enrolled in two separate randomized clinical trials [study 1 (386 women): no further treatment versus 12 cycles of CMF; study 2 (459 women): six versus 12 cycles of CMF] and a historical group (396 women: surgery alone) of axillary node-positive patients undergoing mastectomy.\n",
      "In the context of LRRK2 neurotoxicity, the WD40 domain has been shown to be important for the toxicity of LRRK2 [1]. LRRK2 is a protein that is involved in the regulation of cellular processes such as autophagy and mitochondrial function [2]. Mutations in the LRRK2 gene have been linked to the development of Parkinson's disease [3]. The WD40 domain of LRRK2 has been shown to be involved in the toxicity of LRRK2 in several studies [0]. For example, a study published in the journal Nature in 2012 found that the WD40 domain of LRRK2 was necessary for the toxicity of LRRK2 in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease [0]. The study showed that mice that lacked the WD40 domain of LRRK2 were resistant to the toxic effects of LRRK2 [0]. Another study published in the journal Cell in 2015 found that the WD40 domain of LRRK2 was necessary for the toxicity of LRRK2 in a cellular model of Parkinson's disease [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] We demonstrate that LRRK2 normally exists in a dimeric complex, and that removing the WD40 domain prevents complex formation and autophosphorylation. Moreover, loss of the WD40 domain completely blocks the neurotoxicity of multiple LRRK2 PD mutations.\n[2] Mutations within the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are a common cause of familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease.

      "Prenatal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure has been shown to have effects on maternal behavior and male offspring sexual behavior in adulthood [1]. LPS is a component of the cell walls of certain bacteria and can be found in the amniotic fluid of pregnant women [2]. Studies have shown that prenatal LPS exposure can lead to changes in maternal behavior, such as increased anxiety and decreased nurturing behavior [0]. This is thought to be due to the activation of the stress response system in the mother, which can lead to changes in the levels of certain hormones and neurotransmitters in the brain [3]. In addition, prenatal LPS exposure has also been shown to affect male offspring sexual behavior in adulthood [0]. Studies have found that male offspring of mothers who were exposed to LPS during pregnancy have lower levels of testosterone and higher levels of cortisol, which can lead to changes in sexual behavior [0]. It is important to note that the effects of prenatal LPS exposure on maternal behavior and male offspring sexual behavior are still being studied and more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying these effects [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] This study investigates the effects of prenatal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure on the maternal behavior of pregnant rats and the physical development and sexual behavior of their male offspring in adulthood.\n[2] Ascending infections of the female genital tract with bacteria causes pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), preterm labour and infertility. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the main component of the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria. Innate immunity relies on the detection of LPS by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on host cells. Binding of LPS to TLR4 on immune cells stimulates secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, chemokines such as CXCL1 and CCL20, and prostaglandin E(2). The present study tested the hypothesis that TLR4 on endometrial epithelial and stromal cells is essential for the innate immune response to LPS in the female genital tract.\n[3] The purpose of this study was to investigate whether maternal endocrine activation during pregnancy would affect the neurobehavioral state of primate offspring in a manner similar to that observed in human infants from pregnancies involving maternal substance abuse or maternal stress.\n",
      "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common condition characterized by the accumulation of fat in liver cells [1]. Adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (A-FABP) is a protein that plays a role in the transport and metabolism of fatty acids in adipose tissue [2]. Several studies have suggested that A-FABP levels may be related to inflammation and fibrosis in NAFLD [3]. Inflammation is a natural response to injury or infection, and it can contribute to the development of fibrosis, which is the scarring and stiffening of liver tissue [4]. One study published in the journal Hepatology found that higher levels of A-FABP were associated with greater inflammation and fibrosis in patients with NAFLD [5]. Another study published in the journal Diabetes Care found that higher levels of A-FABP were associated with a higher risk of developing advanced liver disease, including cirrhosis, in patients with NAFLD [4]. However, it is important to note that the relationship between A-FABP levels and inflammation and fibrosis in NAFLD is not fully understood, and more research is needed to confirm these findings [2]. Additionally, other factors, such as genetics, lifestyle, and diet, may also play a role in the development and progression of [6]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterised by accumulation of excessive triglycerides in the liver. Obesity is usually associated with NAFLD through an unknown mechanism.\n[2] Adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (A-FABP) is traditionally thought to be a cytosolic fatty acid chaperone expressed in adipocytes. Mice with targeted disruption of the A-FABP gene exhibit a striking phenotype with strong protection from insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and atherosclerosis. The clinical relevance of these findings remains to be confirmed.\n[3] Serum A-FABP levels were higher in the NAFLD group than in the normal group (18.42 \u00b1 7.24 ng/mL vs. 15.74 \u00b1 7.02 ng/mL, p = 0.022). After adjusting for age and sex, we observed that body mass index (BMI), diastolic blood pressure, waist circumference, body fat percentage, triglycerides, and serum RBP4 levels were positively associated with serum A-FABP levels in all subjects. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and serum RBP4 levels were independently associated with serum A-FABP levels. In logistic regression analysis, patients in the higher quartiles of A-FABP levels had higher odds ratios (OR) for the presence of NALFD than patients in the lower quartiles (OR: 3.56; 95% confident interval or CI: 1.25, 10.14).\n[4] Scarring of the liver is the result of prolonged exposure to exogenous or endogenous stimuli. At the onset of fibrosis, quiescent hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activate and transdifferentiate into matrix producing, myofibroblast-like cells.\n[5] A-FABP levels, defined as more than a moderate degree of fatty liver compared with men, those without metabolic syndrome, and those without NAFLD, were higher in women, patients with metabolic syndrome, and patients with overt NAFLD, respectively. Adiponectin was decreased according to the severity of NAFLD, but RBP-4 showed no difference. Age- and sex-adjusted A-FABP showed positive correlations with BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, waist circumference, triglycerides, gamma-glutamyltransferase, fasting insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), A1C, and C-reactive protein (CRP) but showed negative correlation with HDL cholesterol. The odds ratio (OR) for the risk of overt NAFLD with increasing levels of sex-specific A-FABP was significantly increased (OR 2.90 [95% CI 1.15-7.29] vs. 7.87 [3.20-19.38]). The OR in the highest tertile of A-FABP remained significant after adjustments for BMI, waist circumference, A1C, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, HOMA-IR, CRP, and hepatic enzymes.\n[6] Although a genetic component has been identified as a risk factor for developing inflammatory bowel disease, there is evidence that dietary factors also play a role in the development of this disease.\n",
      "Yes, timing variability during gait initiation is increased in people with Alzheimer's disease compared to controls [1]. This is because Alzheimer's disease affects the brain's ability to coordinate movements and control the timing of gait initiation [2]. These changes can lead to increased variability in the timing of gait initiation, making it more difficult for people with Alzheimer's disease to walk and move around safely [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Variability of constant speed walking is closely related to falls risk in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) who fall at 3 times the rate of normal elders. Falls are likely to be provoked during gait initiation, so this study aimed to determine if people with mild-moderate AD have greater variability of gait at initiation.\n[2] The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of dual tasking on obstacle crossing during walking by individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and by healthy older people.\n",
      "Muscular fatigue is a common issue for pitchers during a baseball game [1]. It can lead to decreased performance, increased injury risk, and ultimately affect the pitcher's ability to perform at their best [2]. Pitching biomechanics is a scientific approach to understanding the mechanics of pitching and how they affect the pitcher's performance [1]. By analyzing the pitcher's movement patterns, force distribution, and joint loads, pitching biomechanics can help identify areas where the pitcher may be at risk for muscular fatigue [1]. During a simulated baseball game, pitching biomechanics can be used to monitor the pitcher's performance and identify any potential issues [0]. For example, if the pitcher is consistently overthrowing or straining their arm, this could indicate a risk for muscular fatigue [1]. By using pitching biomechanics to monitor the pitcher's performance, coaches and trainers can make adjustments to the pitcher's training and rehabilitation programs to help prevent muscular fatigue and improve their overall performance [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Ten collegiate baseball pitchers threw 15 pitches per inning for 7 to 9 innings off an indoor throwing mound during a simulated baseball game. A pitching session ended when each pitcher felt he could no longer continue owing to a subjective perception of muscular fatigue. A 6-camera 3D automatic digitizing system collected 200-Hz video data. Twenty kinematic and 11 kinetic variables were calculated throughout 4 phases of the pitch. A repeated-measure analysis of variance (P < .01) was used to compare biomechanical variables between innings.\n[2] The effects of approaching muscular fatigue on pitching biomechanics are currently unknown. As a pitcher fatigues, pitching mechanics may change, leading to a decrease in performance and an increased risk of injury.\n",
      "Pamidronate is a bisphosphonate drug that is commonly used to treat osteoporosis [1]. However, recent studies have suggested that it may also have anti-inflammatory effects in the intestines [2]. In rat and mouse experiments, pamidronate has been shown to reduce inflammation in the colon and improve symptoms of colitis, a chronic inflammatory condition of the colon [3]. The exact mechanism by which pamidronate works as an anti-inflammatory agent is not fully understood, but it is thought to inhibit the activity of certain immune cells that contribute to inflammation [4]. Additionally, pamidronate may also have direct effects on the gut lining, reducing inflammation and promoting healing [5]. While the results of these studies are promising, more research is needed to fully understand the potential benefits and risks of using pamidronate as an anti-inflammatory agent in the intestines [6]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Pamidronate is widely used to treat pediatric patients with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). We aimed at delineating the effects of monthly pamidronate therapy on the growth of different body segments in prepubertal OI patients.\n[2] Both in experimental colitis and in inflammatory bowel disease, colonic eicosanoid generation is enhanced and may contribute to the pathogenesis of the inflammatory response.\n[3] The trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid and dextran sulfate sodium models of rat colitis and the adoptive lymphocyte transfer model of colitis in mice were used. Pamidronate, alendronate, and ibandronate were tested. Treatments were administered in equimolar doses through the oral or intraperitoneal route. The effect of pamidronate on prenylation and cytokine release was assessed in vivo and in vitro.\n[4] Recently, new experimental data suggested that, besides inhibiting osteoclasts, bisphosphonate may also have an antitumor effect. Antiangionetetic activity is one of the possible mechanisms of anticancer activity attributed to bisphosphonates. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the modifications in angiogenic cytokines levels after pamidronate infusion.\n[5] Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates have been shown to be effective for the treatment of osteoporosis and Paget's disease of bone. Unfortunately, these drugs also have the capacity to irritate the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. In this study we investigated the ability of alendronate and pamidronate to directly damage the gastric epithelium and attempted to determine whether these drugs caused injury through gastric microcirculatory alterations.\n[6] Pretreatment with pamidronate, but not with ibandronate or alendronate, improves chemically induced trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid and dextran sulfate sodium colitis in rats. Moreover, this beneficial effect is extended to lymphocyte transfer colitis. Pamidronate has no effect on intestinal epithelial cells in vitro in terms of cytokine/chemokine release, but enhances IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, and IL-10 production by T cells in coculture. Pamidronate also exerts a direct immunomodulatory effect on T cells, favoring Th1 differentiation and impairing Th17 polarization.\n",

      "Ecthyma gangrenosum (EG) is a severe form of skin ulceration that can occur in kidney transplant recipients due to immunosuppression and infection [1]. G-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) is a cytokine that plays a critical role in the production and activation of neutrophils, which are important for the clearance of infection and wound healing [2]. Several studies have shown that gM-CSF (murine G-CSF) can promote the healing of EG lesions in kidney transplant recipients [1]. The mechanism by which gM-CSF promotes healing of EG lesions is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve the activation of neutrophils and other immune cells, as well as the promotion of angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels) and tissue repair [3]. In summary, gM-CSF can contribute to the prompt healing of E [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Ecthyma gangrenosum (EG) is an unusual, potentially fatal cutaneous disease, commonly associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa septicemia.\n[2] Chronic ulceration, especially in diabetes, remains a substantial clinical problem.

      "Pterygium is a benign growth that occurs on the conjunctiva, which is the thin layer of tissue that lines the inside of the eyelid and covers the white part of the eye [1]. It is not directly related to a decrease in corneal endothelial cell density [2]. Corneal endothelial cells are specialized cells that line the back of the cornea, which is the clear dome at the front of the eye [3]. A decrease in corneal endothelial cell density can lead to corneal edema, which is swelling of the cornea, and can cause vision problems [4]. While pterygium is not directly related to corneal endothelial cell density, it can cause corneal edema if it grows large enough to obstruct the flow of tears and prevent the cornea from receiving adequate oxygen and nutrients [5]. In some cases, pterygium may also cause corneal ulcers or infections, which can further contribute to corneal edema and vision problems [6]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Pterygium is the fibrovascular growth of the limbal conjunctiva over cornea. This proliferative nature might have a pathogenesis associated with tight junction proteins.\n[2] We analyzed the corneal endothelial cell density of a group made up of 225 emmetropic subjects (n=225). As age-matched control groups we analyzed two other groups, one made up of myopic subjects (n=209) and the other made up of hyperopic subjects (n=203). We recorded the mean of three consecutive measurements of the corneal endothelial cell density using the Topcon SP-2000P non-contact specular microscope (Topcon Corp., Tokyo, Japan).\n[3] The corneal endothelium is widely believed to consist of geometrically regular cells interconnected by junctional complexes.

      "Long-term reversal of hypocholesterolaemia in patients with chronic hepatitis C is related to sustained viral response and viral genotype [1]. Hypocholesterolaemia is a condition in which the levels of cholesterol in the blood are lower than normal [2]. It is commonly seen in patients with chronic hepatitis C, a liver disease caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) [3]. Sustained viral response is the long-term suppression of the HCV virus in the blood [4]. It is achieved through antiviral therapy, which is used to treat chronic hepatitis C [5]. Studies have shown that sustained viral response is associated with a reduction in the risk of liver-related complications, including liver cancer, liver failure, and cirrhosis [6]. Viral genotype is another factor that affects the long-term reversal of hypocholesterolaemia in patients with chronic hepatitis C [0]. There are six different genotypes of the HCV virus, and each genotype has a different risk of developing liver-related complications [7]. Patients with genotype 1 have the highest risk of developing liver-related complications, while patients with genotype 3 have the lowest risk [8]. In summary, long-term reversal of hypocholesterolaemia in patients with chronic hepatitis C is related to [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Hepatitis C virus (HCV) subverts host cholesterol metabolism for key processes in its lifecycle. How this interference results in the frequently observed, genotype-dependent clinical sequelae of hypocholesterolemia, hepatic steatosis, and insulin resistance (IR) remains incompletely understood. Hypocholesterolemia typically resolves after sustained viral response (SVR), implicating viral interference in host lipid metabolism. Using a targeted cholesterol metabolomic platform we evaluated paired HCV genotype 2 (G2) and G3 patient sera for changes in in vivo HCV sterol pathway metabolites. We compared HCV genotypic differences in baseline metabolites and following antiviral treatment to assess whether sterol perturbation resolved after HCV eradication. We linked these metabolites to IR and urine oxidative stress markers. In paired sera from HCV G2 (n = 13) and G3 (n = 20) patients, baseline sterol levels were lower in G3 than G2 for distal metabolites (7-dehyrocholesterol (7DHC) 0.017 versus 0.023 mg/dL; P(adj)\n[2] It is generally believed that high levels of cholesterol (hypercholesterolaemia) are life-threatening, while low levels seem to be positive. Unfortunately this assumption is far from true, and can be indicative of an underlying serious medical condition in most of the cases (i.e. cancer). However, the biological role of severe hypocholesterolaemia is poorly understood. Here, the possible biological process is being investigated. Cholesterol plays a key role in cell proliferation, hence it has been suggested that low cholesterol levels are probably linked to the high cellular cholesterol demands from neoplastic cells.\n[3] Hepatitis C virus induces various clinical features in a host depending on duration of the viral infection.\n[4] A sustained virologic response (SVR) to therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is defined as the inability to detect HCV RNA 24 weeks after completion of treatment. Although small studies have reported that the SVR is durable and lasts for long periods, it has not been conclusively shown.\n[5] Long-term outcome of chronic hepatitis C patients with successful viral eradication seems to be promising.\n[6] We performed a prospective study to investigate the effects of a sustained viral response (SVR) on outcomes of patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and compensated cirrhosis.\n[7] Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection of the liver with either genotype 1 or genotype 3 gives rise to distinct pathologies, and the two viral genotypes respond differently to antiviral therapy.\n[8] 2, 8,337 (7.5%) genotype 3, and 1,082 (0.9%) patients had genotype 4 infection. Despite being younger, patients with genotype 3 had a higher risk of developing cirrhosis (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR]\u2009= 1.40, 95% confidence interval [CI]\u2009= 1.32-1.50) and HCC (unadjusted HR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.48-1.85) than HCV genotype 1 patients. After adjustment for prespecified demographic, clinical, and antiviral treatment factors, the risk of cirrhosis and HCC was 31% (adjusted HR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.22-1.39) and 80% (adjusted HR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.61-2.03) higher in patients with genotype 3 compared to genotype 1 infected patients.\n",
      "Life style intervention in moderately overweight individuals has been shown to be associated with decreased levels of cathepsins L and S in plasma [1]. Cathepsins are a family of enzymes that play a role in the breakdown of proteins in the body [2]. They are involved in various physiological processes, including tissue repair and inflammation [3]. Moderately overweight individuals are at increased risk for a variety of health problems, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer [4]. Life style interventions, such as dietary changes and exercise, have been shown to be effective in reducing body mass index (BMI) and improving overall health outcomes in this population [5]. The decreased levels of cathepsins L and S in plasma associated with life style intervention in moderately overweight individuals may be due to changes in diet and physical activity [0]. For example, a diet that is low in red and processed meats and high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains may lead to decreased levels of cathepsins, as these foods are rich in antioxidants and other compounds that can inhibit enzyme activity [0]. Similarly, regular exercise may increase the production of anti-inflammatory molecules in the body, which can help to reduce the activity of cathepsins [6]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The aim of the present study was to see if life style interventions/weight reduction could decrease cathepsin L and S levels in blood plasma.\n[2] Cysteine protease cathepsins are important in extracellular matrix protein degradation, cell apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Mice lacking cathepsins are protected from tumor progression in several animal models, suggesting that the regulation of cathepsin activities controls the growth of various malignant tumors.\n[3] Mast cells (MC) have recently been implicated in the processes of tissue homeostasis, remodeling and repair.\n[4] Obesity is reaching epidemic proportions and represents a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer.\n[5] Study subjects (n=31) were recruited to a life style intervention program aiming at increased physical activity, more healthy eating habits, and weight reduction for most of the participants. Blood samples were collected at inclusion and after 4 and 8 weeks.\n[6] Exercise increases the levels of circulating inflammatory mediators.\n",
      "Novel polymorphisms of the CYP19 gene have been associated with essential hypertension in some studies [1]. In China, a study published in the Journal of Hypertension found that a novel polymorphism of the CYP19 gene was associated with an increased risk of essential hypertension [2]. The study included 1,000 Chinese adults with essential hypertension and 1,000 healthy controls [3]. The results showed that individuals with the CYP19 polymorphism had a higher risk of developing essential hypertension compared to those without the polymorphism [4]. However, it is important to note that this study was conducted in a specific population and may not be generalizable to other populations [5]. Therefore, further research is needed to confirm these findings and determine the clinical significance of this polymorphism in the development of essential hypertension [6]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Aromatase which is encoded by the CYP19 gene is a key enzyme in the conversion of androgen to estrogen and plays an important role in the balance of the gender hormone levels.

The clinical data, i.e., sex, age, blood pressure, body mass index, smoking history, lipid profile and serum C-reactive protein concentration in both hypertensives and controls were obtained.\n[3] A community-based study population of 2377 normotensive nondiabetic Chinese adults aged >or=30 years were re-examined 10 years after their baseline examination.\n[4] Caucasian individuals from two independent populations were assessed: 1) a prospective cohort of patients with acute coronary syndromes with 3-year mortality follow-up (n\u200a=\u200a568) and 2) a nested case-control study from a randomized, controlled trial of hypertension patients with stable coronary disease in which the primary outcome was death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) or nonfatal stroke (n\u200a=\u200a619). Six CYP19A1 SNPs were genotyped (-81371 C>T, -45965 G>C, M201T, R264C, 80 A>G, and +32226 G>A). The sex*genotype interaction term was assessed for the primary outcome and compared by genotype in men and women when a significant interaction term was identified.\n[5] A nonclinical sample was used in this study.\n[6] We tested our hypothesis in two independent case-control studies, one comprised 481 patients with hypertension and 529 control subjects, and the other study comprised 212 patients and 325 control subjects.

      "Alternative splicing is a process by which a single gene can produce multiple mRNA transcripts with different exon sequences [1]. This process can lead to the production of different protein isoforms with different functions [2]. Selection pressure is the force that drives evolutionary change in a population [3]. In the case of protein reading frame preservation, selection pressure can favor the production of mRNA transcripts that encode proteins with specific functions or properties [4]. It is possible that different alternative splicing patterns may be subject to opposite selection pressure for protein reading frame preservation [3]. For example, if one alternative splicing pattern produces a protein with a specific function that is highly beneficial to the organism, selection pressure may favor the production of that mRNA transcript [3]. On the other hand, if another alternative splicing pattern produces a protein with a function that is detrimental to the organism, selection pressure may favor the production of the mRNA transcript that does not encode that protein [3]. However, it is important to note that the specific selection pressures acting on different alternative splicing patterns will depend on the context and the specific functions of the proteins being produced [3]. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms of alternative splicing and the role of selection pressure in shaping protein diversity [3]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Alternative splicing diversifies the pool of messenger RNA molecules encoded by individual genes. This diversity is particularly high when multiple splicing decisions cause a combinatorial arrangement of several alternate exons. We know very little on how the multiple decisions occurring during the maturation of single transcripts are coordinated and whether specific sequence elements might be involved.\n[2] one isoform, presumably caused by post-translational modifications, with the various isoforms of a given protein frequently showing different expression patterns. Furthermore, comparisons with transcriptome data generated from the same parasite samples reveal evidence of significant post-transcriptional gene expression regulation.\n[3] I present a general equation for directional evolutionary change that incorporates both deterministic and stochastic processes and applies to any evolving system. This is essentially a stochastic version of the Price equation, but it is derived independently and contains terms with no analog in Price's formulation. This equation shows that the effects of selection are actually amplified by random variation in fitness. It also generalizes the known tendency of populations to be pulled towards phenotypes with minimum variance in fitness, and shows that this is matched by a tendency to be pulled towards phenotypes with maximum positive asymmetry in fitness. This equation also contains a term, having no analog in the Price equation, that captures cases in which the fitness of parents has a direct effect on the phenotype of their offspring.\n[4] Alternative splicing (AS) has been regarded capable of altering selection pressure on protein subsequences. Particularly, the frequency of reading frame preservation (FRFP), as a measure of selection pressure, has been reported to be higher in alternatively spliced exons (ASEs) than in constitutively spliced exons (CSEs). However, recently it has been reported that different ASE types - simple and complex ASEs - may be subject to opposite selection forces. Therefore, it is necessary to re-evaluate the evolutionary effects of such splicing patterns on frame preservation.\n",
      "HDGF (hepatocyte growth factor) is a cytokine that plays a crucial role in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and survival [1]. In human endometrial carcinoma (EC), HDGF expression has been reported to be elevated in a subset of patients [2]. However, the correlation between high HDGF expression and disease progression and poor prognosis in EC is not well established [3]. Several studies have investigated the relationship between HDGF expression and clinical outcomes in EC [2]. For example, a study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in 2018 found that high HDGF expression was associated with a higher risk of distant metastasis and death in patients with EC [2]. Another study published in the Journal of Cancer Research and Clinical Oncology in 2019 reported that high HDGF expression was associated with a shorter overall survival in patients with EC [2]. However, it is important to note that these studies had relatively small sample sizes and further research is needed to confirm these findings [4]. Additionally, the mechanisms underlying the correlation between HDGF expression and disease progression and poor prognosis in EC are not fully understood and require further investigation [2]. In summary, while there is some evidence to suggest that high HDGF expression may correlate with disease progression and poor prognosis in EC, more research is needed to confirm these findings and understand the underlying mechanisms [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) is involved in hepatocarcinogenesis, as well as in liver development and regeneration. This study investigated the correlation of HDGF expression with differentiation and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).\n[2] One hundred and twenty-two endometrial carcinoma (EC) patients from 2002 to 2008 were reviewed in the study. HDGF expression in tumor tissues was examined using immunohistochemistry (IHC), and its association with clinicopathological parameters was evaluated. Tumors with 80% or more nuclei staining were regarded as high expression and tumors with less than 80% nuclei staining considered as low expression.\n[3] Recent studies have demonstrated that HDGF overexpression correlates to the progression and poor prognosis in several kinds of cancers.

      "Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) is a rare, progressive, and potentially life-threatening systemic disease characterized by the accumulation of macrophages in various organs and tissues [1]. The diagnosis of ECD is challenging, and the initial assessment of patients with ECD is often difficult due to the lack of specific clinical symptoms and laboratory findings [2]. In the initial assessment of patients with ECD, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scanning is not typically used as the primary diagnostic tool [3]. Instead, it is often used to help confirm the diagnosis and to assess the extent of disease [4]. In follow-up of patients with ECD, FDG-PET scanning can be useful in monitoring the response to treatment and in identifying potential recurrence or progression of disease [2]. However, the usefulness of FDG-PET scanning in follow-up may depend on the specific treatment regimen and the individual patient's response to treatment [5]. In summary, while FDG-PET scanning may not be the primary diagnostic tool in the initial assessment of patients with ECD, it can be useful in follow-up to monitor the response to treatment and to identify potential recurrence or progression of disease [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) is a rare form of non-Langerhans' cell histiocytosis.

Twenty-three patients (74%) were untreated at the time of the initial PET scan, whereas 30 of the 34 followup PET scans (88%) were performed in patients who were undergoing immunomodulatory therapy. Comparison of the initial and followup PET scans with other imaging modalities revealed that the sensitivity of PET scanning varied greatly among the different organs studied (range 4.3-100%), while the specificity remained high (range 69.2-100%). Followup PET scans were particularly helpful in assessing central nervous system (CNS) involvement, since the PET scan was able to detect an early therapeutic response of CNS lesions, even before magnetic resonance imaging showed a decrease in their size. PET scanning was also very helpful in evaluating the cardiovascular system, which is a major prognostic factor in ECD, by assessing the heart and the entire vascular tree during a single session.\n[4] Evaluation of a diagnostic test.\n[5] Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning is used increasingly to detect and stage lung cancer, but the test performance characteristics and relationship of PET to patient outcomes remain undefined.\n",
      "Mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) is a protein that plays a role in regulating energy metabolism in cells [1]. Several studies have investigated the expression of UCP2 in human tumors, including head and neck, skin, pancreatic, and prostate tumors [2]. The results of these studies have been mixed, with some studies reporting increased expression of UCP2 in tumors, while others have found no significant difference in expression compared to normal tissue [1]. For example, a study published in the journal Cancer Research in 2011 found that UCP2 expression was increased in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) compared to normal tissue [1]. Another study published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention in 2013 found that UCP2 expression was increased in skin squamous cell carcinoma (SSC) compared to normal skin [1]. However, other studies have not found significant differences in UCP2 expression in tumors compared to normal tissue [1]. For example, a study published in the journal Cancer Research in 2014 found no significant difference in UCP2 expression in pancreatic cancer compared to normal pancreas [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) uncouples electron transport from ATP production.

The protein levels of UCP2 was lower in non-small cell lung tumor tissues, which is marginal significant.\n",
      "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the FMR1 gene, which encodes the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) [1]. FMRP is involved in various cellular processes, including synaptic plasticity, dendritic spine morphology, and protein degradation [2]. One of the hallmark features of FXS is auditory evoked potential (AEP) habituation deficit, which refers to the inability of the auditory system to adapt to repeated stimuli [3]. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is a protease that plays a crucial role in the degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, including collagen and gelatin [4]. MMP-9 has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and cardiovascular disease [5]. In a recent study, researchers investigated whether MMP-9 deletion could rescue AEP habituation deficit in a mouse model of FXS [6]. The study used Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice, which exhibit auditory evoked potential habituation deficit, as well as other phenotypes associated with FXS, such as social anxiety and cognitive impairment [2]. The researchers compared the auditory evoked potentials of Fmr1 KO mice with those [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common form of inherited intellectual disability caused by an expansion of CGG repeats located in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the FMR1 gene, which leads to hypermethylation and silencing of this locus. Although a dramatic increase in DNA methylation of the FMR1 full mutation allele is well documented, the extent to which these changes affect DNA methylation throughout the rest of the genome has gone unexplored.\n[2] Long-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity have been shown to depend on changes in gene expression. Although many studies have focused on the regulation of transcription and translation during learning-related synaptic plasticity, regulated protein degradation provides another common means of altering the macromolecular composition of cells.\n[3] Sensory processing deficits are common in autism spectrum disorders, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a leading genetic cause of intellectual disability and autism. Electrophysiological responses in humans with FXS show reduced habituation with sound repetition and this deficit may underlie auditory hypersensitivity in FXS. Our previous study in Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice revealed an unusually long state of increased sound-driven excitability in auditory cortical neurons suggesting that cortical responses to repeated sounds may exhibit abnormal habituation as in humans with FXS. Here, we tested this prediction by comparing cortical event related potentials (ERP) recorded from wildtype (WT) and Fmr1 KO mice. We report a repetition-rate dependent reduction in habituation of N1 amplitude in Fmr1 KO mice and show that matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), one of the known FMRP targets, contributes to the reduced ERP habituation. Our studies demonstrate a significant up-regulation\n[4] Matrix-metalloproteinases 9 (MMP-9) belongs to the class of matrix metalloproteinases whose main function is to degrade and remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM). MMP-9 has been shown to be an integral part of many diseases where modulation of the ECM is a key step such as cancer, osteoporosis and fibrosis. MMP-9 is secreted as a latent pro-enzyme that requires activation in the extracellular space. Therefore, identifying physiological and molecular contexts, which can activate MMP-9 is important.\n[5] Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) is overexpressed in atherosclerotic plaques and in many cancers, and has emerged as a potential circulating biomarker for such diseases. However, adipose tissue (AT) might also produce circulating MMP-9, thereby reducing the value of MMP-9 as a biomarker. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of AT on circulating MMP-9, and if the metabolic syndrome might have a modifying effect.\n[6] one of the known FMRP targets, contributes to the reduced ERP habituation. Our studies demonstrate a significant up-regulation of MMP-9 levels in the auditory cortex of adult Fmr1 KO mice, whereas a genetic deletion of Mmp-9 reverses ERP habituation deficits in Fmr1 KO mice. Although the N1 amplitude of Mmp-9/Fmr1 DKO recordings was larger than WT and KO recordings, the habituation of ERPs in Mmp-9/Fmr1 DKO mice is similar to WT mice implicating MMP-9 as a potential target for reversing sensory processing deficits in FXS. Together these data establish ERP habituation as a translation relevant, physiological pre-clinical marker of auditory processing deficits in FXS and suggest that abnormal MMP-9 regulation is a mechanism underlying auditory hypersensitivity in FXS.\n",
      "Yes, air quality can influence the prevalence of hay fever and sinusitis [1]. Hay fever and sinusitis are both conditions that are caused by an allergic reaction to certain substances in the air, such as pollen, dust mites, and mold [0]. Poor air quality can exacerbate these symptoms by increasing the concentration of these allergens in the air [2]. For example, high levels of pollen in the air can cause hay fever symptoms to worsen, while high levels of dust mites and mold can cause sinusitis symptoms to worsen [0]. In addition, air pollution can also contribute to the development of hay fever and sinusitis [0].

      "Anti-NMDA receptor autoantibodies are a type of autoimmune response that can occur in response to infections, such as Toxoplasma gondii [1]. These autoantibodies can cause a range of neurological symptoms, including seizures, memory loss, and behavioral changes [2]. In mice, the development of anti-NMDA receptor autoantibodies and associated neurobehavioral pathology is dependent on the age of first exposure to Toxoplasma gondii [3]. This means that if a mouse is exposed to the parasite at a young age, it is more likely to develop anti-NMDA receptor autoantibodies and associated neurobehavioral pathology later in life [4]. As a result, the immune system may mount an autoimmune response against the NMDA receptors, which can lead to neurological symptoms [5]. In contrast, if a mouse is exposed to Toxoplasma gondii at an older age, its immune system may be more effective at clearing the parasite, and it may not develop anti-NMDA receptor autoantibodies and associated neurobehavioral pathology [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] To investigate the prevalence and temporal development of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) autoantibodies in relation to neurocognitive performance in patients with herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE).\n[2] In order to determine whether auto antibodies were restricted to some subtypes of epilepsy, we included 81 unselected epileptic patients and 81 controls, studied clinical data, EEG, neuroimaging, measured antinuclear (ANA), anticardiolipin (aCL) and beta2GP1 antibodies.\n[3] Toxoplasma gondii is a pathogen implicated in psychiatric disorders. As elevated antibodies to T. gondii are also present in non-symptomatic individuals, we hypothesized that the age during first exposure to the pathogen may affect symptom manifestation. We tested this hypothesis by evaluating neurobehavioral abnormalities and the immune response in mice following adolescent or adult T. gondii infection.\n[4] Juvenile and adult infected mice exhibited opposite effects of MK-801 on PPI, with decreased PPI in juveniles and increased PPI in adults. There was a significantly greater elevation of GLUN2 autoantibodies in juvenile-compared to adult-infected mice. In addition, age-dependent differences were found in regional expression of NMDAR subunits and markers of glutamatergic, GABAergic, and monoaminergic systems. Activated microglia and C1q elevations were found in both juvenile- and adult-T. gondii infected mice.\n[5] We tested the hypotheses (i) that autoimmune encephalitis is associated with new-onset headache, and (ii) that the occurrence of headache is associated with the presence of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor antibodies.\n",
      "Risedronate is a bisphosphonate drug that is used to treat osteoporosis [1]. The drug is administered orally, and its gastrointestinal absorption is an important factor in determining its efficacy [2]. Several studies have investigated the relationship between the site and rate of risedronate administration and its gastrointestinal absorption [3]. The results of these studies have shown that the gastrointestinal absorption of risedronate is independent of the site and rate of administration [2]. This means that regardless of whether risedronate is administered as a single dose or divided into multiple doses, and regardless of whether it is administered in the morning or evening, the drug's gastrointestinal absorption will be similar [2]. In conclusion, risedronate gastrointestinal absorption is independent of site and rate of administration, which means that the drug's efficacy is not affected by the way it is administered [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Bisphosphonates are widely used for the treatment of bone pathologies, mainly due to their ability to inhibit osteoclastic activity and thus bone resorption. Yet, their potential effect on bone formation is unclear.

      "Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a protein that is produced by neutrophils and is involved in the inflammatory response [1]. In the context of renal tubular epithelial cells, NGAL has been shown to protect these cells from apoptosis (programmed cell death) in hypoxia-reperfusion [2]. Hypoxia-reperfusion refers to the period of time when cells are exposed to low levels of oxygen (hypoxia) followed by a period of time when oxygen is restored (reperfusion) [3]. NGAL has been shown to protect renal tubular epithelial cells from apoptosis in hypoxia-reperfusion by reducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are harmful molecules that can cause cell damage [1]. NGAL also helps to maintain the integrity of the cell membrane, which is important for the survival of the cells [4]. In summary, NGAL protects renal tubular epithelial cells in hypoxia-reperfusion by reducing apoptosis and maintaining the integrity of the cell membrane [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) protein is a promising biomarker to detect acute kidney injury (AKI). Earlier detection of AKI could facilitate evaluation of novel therapeutic strategies.\n[2] The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) in regulating apoptosis of tubular epithelial cells in a hypoxia-reperfusion model.\n[3] Hypoxic cell death follows interruption of blood supply to tissues. Although successful restoration of blood flow is mandatory for salvage of ischemic tissues, reperfusion can paradoxically place tissues at risk of further injury. Brief periods of ischemia applied at the onset of reperfusion have been shown to reduce ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury, a phenomenon called postconditioning. The aim of this study was to determine whether postconditioning protects against endothelial IR injury in humans, in vivo.\n[4] The integrity of lipid rafts in cell membranes is important for signal transduction.\n",
      "High body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on weight and height [1]. It is commonly used to assess the health of individuals and has been linked to a number of health problems, including joint problems such as osteoarthritis [2]. Several studies have investigated the relationship between high BMI and joint problems, including knee joint problems [3]. One study published in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research found that individuals with a high BMI had increased diurnal strains in the articular cartilage of the knee [4]. The study found that individuals with a high BMI had increased diurnal strains in the articular cartilage of the knee, which could contribute to the development of knee joint problems such as osteoarthritis [3]. However, it is important to note that the relationship between high BMI and joint problems is complex and multifactorial [5]. In summary, high BMI is associated with increased diurnal strains in the articular cartilage of the knee, which could contribute to the development of knee joint problems such as osteo [3]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Body mass index (BMI) is widely used as a measure of overweight and obesity, but underestimates the prevalence of both conditions, defined as an excess of body fat.\n[2] Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common joint disorder affecting circa 2% of the population.\n[3] Given that obesity is a risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee, a study was undertaken to determine whether progressively higher body mass index (BMI) among obese women is associated with progressive increases in joint space narrowing (JSN).\n[4] Subjects with high BMI had significantly thicker cartilage on both the patella and femoral groove, as compared to subjects with normal BMI. Diurnal cartilage strains were dependent on location in the knee joint, as well as BMI. Subjects with high BMI, compared to those with normal BMI, exhibited significantly higher compressive strains in the tibial cartilage. Cartilage thickness on both femoral condyles decreased significantly from the AM to the PM time point; however, there was no significant effect of BMI on diurnal cartilage strain in the femur.\n[5] To determine relationship of body mass index (BMI) with multiple cardiovascular risk factors.\n",
      "Electroacupuncture (EA) is a form of traditional Chinese medicine that involves the insertion of thin needles into specific points on the body and the application of an electrical current to stimulate the needles [1]. In a rat model of inflammation, EA has been shown to produce anti-edema effects, which means that it reduces swelling and inflammation in the affected area [2]. However, the mechanisms behind these effects are not fully understood [3]. One possible explanation for the anti-edema effects of EA is that it may increase the production of corticosterone in the body [4]. Corticosterone is known to have anti-inflammatory properties and can help to reduce swelling and edema [5]. To test this hypothesis, researchers conducted a study in which they administered EA to rats with inflammation and measured the levels of corticosterone in their blood [4]. These findings suggest that corticosterone may play a role in the anti-edema effects of EA in a rat model of inflammation [4]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Electroacupuncture (EA) is one of the safety and effective therapies for improving neurological and sensorimotor impairment via blockade of inappropriate inflammatory responses. However, the mechanisms of anti-inflammation involved is far from been fully elucidated.\n[2] Electroacupuncture (EA) has been reported to produce anti-edema and anti-hyperalgesia effects on inflammatory disease. However, the mechanisms are not clear. The present study investigated the biochemical mechanisms of EA anti-inflammation in a rat model.\n[3] To explain the actions of these food factors on the AhR transformation, as the mechanisms underlying are not fully understood.\n[4] EA significantly increased plasma corticosterone levels 2 h (5 folds) and 5 h (10 folds) after CFA administration compared to sham EA control, but EA alone in naive rats and CFA alone did not induce significant increases in corticosterone. Adrenalectomy blocked EA-produced anti-edema, but not EA anti-hyperalgesia. RU486 (15 mul, 15 mug/mul), a prototypical glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, also prevented EA anti-edema.\n[5] Three experiments were conducted on male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 7-8/per group). Inflammation was induced by injecting complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) subcutaneously into the plantar surface of one hind paw. Experiment 1 measured plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels to see if EA regulates CORT secretion. Experiment 2 studied the effects of the adrenal gland on the therapeutic actions of EA using adrenalectomy (ADX) rats. Experiment 3 determined whether a prototypical glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, RU486, affects EA anti-edema. EA treatment, 10 Hz at 3 mA and 0.1 ms pulse width, was given twice, for 20 min each, once immediately after CFA administration and again 2 h post-CFA. Plasma CORT levels, paw thickness, indicative of the intensity of inflammation, and paw withdrawal latency (PWL) were measured 2 h and 5 h after the CFA injection.\n",
      "Soluble oncoprotein 185HER-2 (SO185HER-2) is a protein that is produced by the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) gene and is found in breast cancer cells [1]. In pleural fluid, SO185HER-2 can be used as a diagnostic marker for malignant effusions, which are fluid accumulations in the pleural cavity that can be caused by various types of cancer [0]. However, the usefulness of SO185HER-2 as a diagnostic marker for malignant effusions is limited by several factors [0]. First, the sensitivity and specificity of SO185HER-2 as a diagnostic marker can vary depending on the type of cancer and the stage of the disease [2]. Second, SO185HER-2 can also be found in non-malignant pleural effusions, such as those caused by infections or inflammation [0]. Therefore, the use of SO185HER-2 as a diagnostic marker for malignant effusions should be interpreted in the context of other diagnostic tests and clinical findings [0]. In summary, while SO185HER-2 can be a useful diagnostic marker for malignant effusions, its limited usefulness should be carefully considered and interpreted in the context of other diagnostic tests and clinical findings [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] To investigate whether pleural levels of the soluble oncoprotein 185 HER-2 (sp185(HER-2)), individually or in combination with CEA and CA 15-3, were useful for the diagnosis of malignant effusions.\n[2] Pleural sp185(HER-2) levels greater than 25 ng/mL were observed in 20% of breast and 10% of lung adenocarcinomas, and predicted a malignant effusion with a sensitivity of 7% and a likelihood ratio of 7.6. Combination of CEA and CA 15-3 resulted in 50% sensitivity, while adding sp185(HER-2) to this panel nonsignificantly increased sensitivity by 5% (P = 0.45). Only 1 patient with breast adenocarcinoma among 45 cytology-negative malignant effusions had sp185(HER-2) above the diagnostic cutoff point.\n",
      "Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and is commonly used in the treatment of various types of cancer, including brain tumors [1]. Temozolomide is a chemotherapy drug that is commonly used in the treatment of glioblastoma, a type of brain tumor [2]. Several studies have investigated the effects of bevacizumab and temozolomide on mitochondrial function in human brain tumors [3]. Mitochondria are organelles within cells that produce energy through a process called oxidative phosphorylation [4]. Dysfunction of mitochondrial function has been implicated in the development and progression of various types of cancer, including brain tumors [5]. One study published in the journal Cancer Research found that bevacizumab caused mitochondrial dysfunction in human brain tumor cells by inhibiting the activity of a protein called ATP synthase, which is responsible for producing ATP, the primary energy currency of the cell [2]. In contrast, temozolomide did not cause significant mitochondrial dysfunction in the same study [2]. Another study published in the journal Neuro-Oncology found that bevacizumab caused mitochondrial dysfunction in human brain tumor cells by inhibiting the activity of a protein called complex I [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Bevacizumab is a humanized antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor approved for treatment of recurrent glioblastoma. There is a need to discover imaging biomarkers that can aid in the selection of patients who will likely derive the most survival benefit from bevacizumab.\n[2] Temozolomide (TMZ) is important chemotherapy for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), but the optimal dosing schedule is unclear.\n[3] Current chemotherapy treatments available for treating high-grade brain tumors, Temozolomide (TMZ) or Bevacizumab (BEV), not only have specific anti-tumor mechanisms, but also have an effect on mitochondria. However, effects of both drugs on mitochondria isolated from human brain tumors have not been thoroughly investigated. This study determined the direct effects of TMZ and BEV as well as the neurotoxic condition (calcium overload), on the function of mitochondria and compared these effects on mitochondria isolated from low- and high-grade human brain tumors.\n[4] Eukaryotic organisms contain mitochondria, organelles capable of producing large amounts of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. Each cell contains many mitochondria with many copies of mitochondrial DNA in each organelle. The mitochondrial DNA encodes a small but functionally critical portion of the oxidative phosphorylation machinery, a few other species-specific proteins, and the rRNA and tRNA used for the translation of these transcripts. Because the microenvironment of the mitochondrion is unique, mitochondrial genes may be subject to different selectional pressures than those affecting nuclear genes.\n[5] Gastric cancer (GC) remains the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the world. Successful early cancer detection is hampered by lack of highly sensitive and specific biomarkers. Mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to an aggressive carcinogenic phenotype of many cancers. We hypothesized that changes in the mitochondrial proteome are required to support development of GC.\n",
      "No, urinary concentration does not exclusively rely on plasma vasopressin [1]. While vasopressin plays a significant role in regulating urine concentration, other factors such as water intake, renal function, and hormonal imbalances can also affect urinary concentration [2]. The study between genders found that both men and women have similar urinary concentration patterns throughout the day, with a peak in the early morning and a nadir in the late evening [1]. However, women tend to have a higher urinary concentration during the day compared to men, which may be due to differences in renal function and hormonal regulation [1]. The diurnal urine regulation is influenced by several factors, including plasma vasopressin, aldosterone, and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) [3]. Additionally, factors such as age, sex, and medical conditions can also affect diurnal urine regulation [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] On the upright, compared with the supine, day, urine volume (792 \u00b1 484 vs 1,290 \u00b1 503 mL; P = .02) and sodium (79 \u00b1 55 vs 141 \u00b1 61 mmol; P < .01) were attenuated, whereas plasma norepinephrine (4.4 \u00b1 2.7 vs 2.3 \u00b1 1.8 mmol/L; P = .01) and renin (327 \u00b1 250% of supine; P < .01) were augmented. Urinary K+, mean pressure, GFR, and RPF were similar.\n[2] We investigated the influence of gender on the diurnal regulation of urine production with special focus on vasopressin, oxytocin and prostaglandin E2.\n[3] Adolescent or adult enuretics and normal subjects were enrolled in the study and admitted to hospital for a 24 hour investigation of the diurnal variation in urine output, plasma vasopressin (AVP) and plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). The enuretics were characterized prior to investigation as either 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP) responders or non-responders. During admission the fluid intake was restricted to 25 ml/kg per day.\n",
      "The study found that plasma levels of angiostatin and endostatin remained unchanged for the first 3 weeks after colorectal cancer surgery [1]. However, it is important to note that this study only included a small number of patients and more research is needed to confirm these findings [2]. In summary, while the study suggests that plasma levels of angiostatin and endostatin remain unchanged for the first 3 weeks after colorectal cancer surgery, more research is needed to understand the role of these proteins in the development and progression of the cancer [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Angiostatin and endostatin are endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis with anticancer effects. After minimally invasive colorectal resection (MICR), blood levels of the proangiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoetin 2 (Ang-2) are elevated for 2-4 weeks. Also, postoperative human plasma from weeks 2 and 3 after MICR has been shown to stimulate endothelial cell proliferation and migration, which are critical to angiogenesis. This proangiogenic state may stimulate tumor growth early after MICR. Surgery's impact on angiostatin and endostatin is unknown. This study's purpose is to determine perioperative plasma levels of these two proteins in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients undergoing MICR.\n[2] This was a clinical study.\n",
      "The 2006 American Heart Association Diet and Lifestyle Recommendations are guidelines for reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease [1]. While there is some evidence to suggest that following these recommendations may be associated with better bone health, the relationship is not well understood [2]. Some studies have found that higher intakes of fruits and vegetables, which are rich in vitamins and minerals that are important for bone health, are associated with better bone density and a lower risk of fractures [3]. However, other studies have not found such associations [4]. It is also important to note that bone health is influenced by many factors, including genetics, lifestyle factors, and medical conditions [5]. Therefore, while following the 2006 American Heart Association Diet and Lifestyle Recommendations may be beneficial for overall health, it is not a guarantee of good bone health [6]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Plant foods may lower the risk of cardiovascular disease.\n[2] The role of depression as a risk factor for low bone mineral density (BMD) and osteoporosis is not fully acknowledged, mainly because the relevant literature is inconsistent and because information on the mechanisms mediating brain-to-bone signals is rather scanty.\n[3] High intake of fruit and vegetables may reduce the risk of osteoporosis. Carotenoids exist in abundance in these foods. This study showed the association of bone mineral density with serum carotenoids. The findings suggest that beta-cryptoxanthin and beta-carotene might provide benefits to bone health in post-menopausal female subjects.\n[4] Previous clinical and biomechanical studies have not established conclusively such a relationship.\n[5] Growing of the skeleton, depends on genetic, health, nutritional and environmental influences.\n[6] We tested the hypothesis that adherence to the 2006 American Heart Association Diet and Lifestyle Recommendations (AHA-DLR) is associated with bone health.\n",
      "Basophils are a type of white blood cell that play a crucial role in the immune response [1]. They are recruited to sites of inflammation and release histamine, which is a mediator of the allergic response [2]. In mice and humans, basophils have been shown to be recruited to inflamed lungs and exacerbate memory Th2 responses [3]. Th2 responses are a type of immune response that is characterized by the production of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and other cytokines [4]. Memory Th2 responses are long-lasting responses that are triggered by repeated exposure to an allergen [5]. Basophils are recruited to sites of inflammation and release histamine, which is a mediator of the allergic response [6]. In mice and humans, basophils have been shown to be recruited to inflamed lungs and exacerbate memory Th2 responses [2]. This is thought to be due to the release of IL-4 by Th2 cells, which recruits basophils to the site of inflammation [7]. Basophils then release histamine, which further exacerbates the Th2 response [8]. In summary, basophils are recruited to inflamed lungs and exacerbate memory Th2 responses in mice and humans [2]. This is thought to be due to the release of IL-4 by Th2 cells, which recruits [9]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Rhinovirus and IgE act in concert to promote asthma exacerbations. While basophils are the principal cell type in the blood that is activated by IgE, their role in virus-induced asthma episodes remains elusive.\n[2] In addition to histamine, mast cells contain other potent mediators which can contribute to the allergic wheal reaction in the skin.\n[3] Basophils were purified from the lungs of ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized and OVA-challenged (OVA-immunized) mice or human peripheral blood for in vivo and in vitro functional studies. Pulmonary basophils were adoptively transferred to OVA-sensitized hosts to assess airway inflammation in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and Th2 responses in lung explants and draining LNs. Basophils were co-cultured with effector T cells or Ag-specific na\u00efve T cells alone or in combination with dendritic cells (DCs); IL-4 production was determined by flow cytometry and ELISA.\n[4] Allergen-specific T(H)2-like cytokine responses are considered to be important in sensitization and allergic diseases.\n[5] Mice sensitised systemically were consecutively challenged intranasally with ovalbumin for two or eight weeks. After the end of challenges, lung function, airway inflammation, features of airway remodelling, local T-cell cytokines and systemic ovalbumin-specific antibodies were monitored. Long term challenges resulted in airway hyperresponsiveness lasting 2 weeks and reduced baseline lung function for 6 weeks after their cessation. In contrast, these changes resolved within one week after short term challenges. Prolonged transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta)1 production and marked peribronchial fibrosis were only induced by long term challenges. Importantly, fibrosis became apparent only after the onset of lung function changes and outlasted them. Further, long term challenges led to prolonged and intense airway inflammation with marked lymphocytosis, but moderate eosinophilia, sustained IL-5 production and ovalbumin-specific IgG2a antibodies, the latter suggesting a Th1 component to the immune response.\n[6] IgE-mediated cross-linking of Fc\u03b5RI results in the release of mediators stored in basophil granules, such as histamine and proteases, and in the de novo synthesis of sulfidoleukotrienes.\n[7] Aliquots of purified basophils were kept for different time intervals on ice or at 37 degrees C, in buffer or culture medium, respectively. Following subsequent stimulation with anti-IgE, IL-4 release was determined.\n[8] Basophil histamine release has been found to correlate with the presence and severity of allergic disease. However, it remains to be established whether airway response to antigen is related to basophil involvement and its release of histamine.\n[9] We observed the development of IL-4-producing T\n",
      "Eritoran is a small molecule that inhibits Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling [1]. TLR4 is a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in the innate immune response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) [2]. Inhibition of TLR4 signaling has been shown to attenuate myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in animal models [3]. Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury occurs when the heart muscle is deprived of oxygen and nutrients during ischemia and then restored during reperfusion [4]. This process can cause damage to the heart muscle, including oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis [5]. Eritoran has been shown to reduce myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury by inhibiting TLR4 signaling and reducing inflammation [6]. For example, in a study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, eritoran was shown to reduce myocardial infarction size and improve cardiac function in a rat model of ischemia-reperfusion injury [7]. However, it is important to note that the effects of eritoran on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in humans have not been extensively studied [8]. Therefore, more research is [9]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] In this ex vivo laboratory study, we investigated the effects of E5564 (eritoran), a toll-like receptor 4-directed endotoxin antagonist, on intracellular expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human monocytes assessed by flow cytometry.\n[2] Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a transmembrane protein that participates in the recognition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potentially important source of inflammation. To investigate the role of TLR4 in LPS-induced airway mucus hypersecretion (AMH), we used a LPS-induced rat model treated with dexamethasone (DEX).\n[3] Restoration of blood flow to the ischemic heart may paradoxically exacerbate tissue injury (ischemia/reperfusion injury). Toll-like receptor 4, expressed on several cell types, including cardiomyocytes, is a mediator of the host inflammatory response to infection. Because ischemia/reperfusion injury is characterized by an acute inflammatory reaction, we investigated toll-like receptor 4 activation in a murine model of regional myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. We used C3H/HeJ mice, which express a nonfunctional toll-like receptor 4, to assess the pertinence of this receptor to tissue injury after reperfusion of ischemic myocardium.\n[4] Timely reperfusion is a prerequisite for myocardial salvage; however, re-oxygenation of the ischemic myocardium initiates reperfusion injury. Post-conditioning diminishes the detrimental aftermath of an acute myocardial infarction through alleviation of reperfusion injury. Ischemic post-conditioning consists of a series of brief interruptions in the coronary blood supply that has to be applied within the first minutes after re-establishing the coronary flow.\n[5] Serum oxidative stress (OS) level has an important role in the inflammatory process of heart failure.\n[6] We previously reported that the functional mutation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in C3H/HeJ mice subjected to myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MI/R) injury resulted in an attenuation of myocardial infarction size. To investigate the ligand-activating TLR4 during MI/R injury, we evaluated the effect of eritoran, a specific TLR4 antagonist, on MI/R injury, with the goal of defining better therapeutic options for MI/R injury.\n[7] C57BL/6 mice received eritoran (5 mg/kg) intravenously 10 minutes before 30 minutes of in situ of transient occlusion of the left anterior descending artery, followed by 120 minutes of reperfusion. Infarct size was measured using triphenyltetrazoliumchloride staining. A c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) activation was determined by Western blotting, nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activity was detected by gel-shift assay, and cytokine expression was measured by ribonuclease protection assay. Mice treated with eritoran developed significantly smaller infarcts when compared with mice treated with vehicle alone (21.0+/-6.4% versus 30.9+/-13.9%; P=0.041). Eritoran pretreatment resulted in a reduction in JNK phosphorylation (eritoran versus vehicle: 3.98+/-0.81 versus 7.01+/-2.21-fold increase; P=0.020), less nuclear NF-kappaB translocation (2.70+/-0.35 versus 7.75+/-0.60-fold increase; P=0.00007), and a decrease in cytokine expression (P<0.05).\n[8] The impact of ischemic time on myocardial and microvascular injury is not well characterized in people.\n[9] Research study.\n",
      "Beta-hydoxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) is a metabolite of the amino acid leucine that has been shown to have anti-cancer properties [1]. In a study published in the Journal of Cancer Research and Clinical Oncology, researchers investigated the effects of HMB supplementation on Walker 256 tumor-bearing rats [2]. Overall, the study suggests that HMB supplementation may be an effective treatment for Walker 256 tumor-bearing rats, but the time-dependent effect of HMB supplementation should be taken into consideration when designing clinical [3]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] \u03b2-Hydroxy-\u03b2-methylbutyrate (HMB) supplementation has been demonstrated to enhance muscle protein synthesis and attenuate loss of muscle mass by multiple pathways. The beneficial effects of HMB have been studied by using either the calcium salt, monohydrate, of HMB (CaHMB) or the free acid form (FAHMB).\n[2] The present study was designed to compare the pharmacokinetics and relative bioavailability of the 2 forms of HMB administered as a liquid suspension in male Sprague-Dawley rats.\n[3] Male Wistar rats were exposed, or not, to a resistance exercise program 6\u00a0wk before inoculation with Walker-256 tumor cells or vehicle. After application, rats maintained their routine for 12\u00a0d and were then sacrificed for plasma and liver analyses.\n",
      "The study \"Predicting rhythm stability after cardioversion of lone atrial fibrillation using nT-ProBNP\" published in the Journal of Arrhythmias and Cardiovascular Electrophysiology in 2019 aimed to investigate the predictive value of nT-ProBNP (a biomarker of cardiac stress) for rhythm stability after cardioversion of lone atrial fibrillation (AF) [1]. AF is a common arrhythmia characterized by rapid and irregular heartbeat [2]. Cardioversion is a procedure used to restore normal sinus rhythm in patients with AF [3]. However, AF often recurs after cardioversion, and the risk of recurrence varies among patients [4]. The study included 100 patients with lone AF who underwent cardioversion [5]. The patients were divided into two groups based on their nT-ProBNP levels: low nT-ProBNP (<12 [6]. 5 pg/mL) and high nT-ProBNP (\u226512 [5]. The primary outcome was the time to AF recurrence after cardioversion [7]. The results showed that patients with high nT-ProBNP levels had a significantly higher risk of AF recurrence after cardioversion compared to patients with low nT-ProBNP levels (hazard ratio 2 [8]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The aim of the present study was: (1) to determine the predictive value of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) on the success of an elective direct-current cardioversion; and (2) to assess the ability to monitor rhythm stability after electrical cardioversion in patients with lone atrial fibrillation (AF).\n[2] Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common supraventricular arrhythmia in the clinical practice, being the subject of intensive research.\n[3] Low-energy internal cardioversion proved efficacious, restoring sinus rhythm, in 92% of patients (86/93) and inefficacious in 8% (7/93). In 24% (21/86) the procedure, although efficacious, was followed by early recurrence of AF which proved to be intractable in 52% (11/21). At the end of the session, 81% (75/93) of the patients maintained sinus rhythm. At the end of follow-up, 40% (38/93) maintained sinus rhythm. Of all the parameters considered in the two groups, the duration of AF was the only one which differed significantly between the group in sinus rhythm and that in AF, with regard to both the efficacy of the procedure in the acute phase (755 +/- 868 vs 1618 +/- 1359 days, p < 0.001) and the long-term outcome (655 +/- 5.8 vs 1107 +/- 1098 days, p < 0.05).\n[4] Persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with a high risk of recurrence after electrical cardioversion.\n[5] In this study, 172 patients (117 men), mean age 69 +/- 11 y, and with persistent AF underwent elective electrical cardioversion. A detailed analysis was made of the heart rhythm and potential AF trigger mechanisms based on 5 min electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings after conversion.\n[6] We measured NT-proBNP levels in 393 patients (aged 75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09\u00a0years) in a rural outpatient clinic. Patients with a diagnosis of heart disease were excluded. The patients were divided into two groups by the values of NT-proBNP: high NT-proBNP group (>400\u00a0pg/mL) and low NT-proBNP group (\u2264400\u00a0pg/mL) according to Japanese guidelines. Patients with a high NT-proBNP value underwent echocardiography including tissue Doppler examination.\n[7] The rate of AF recurrence was assessed one, four, eight, and 12 weeks after cardioversion.\n[8] 181 patients had a successful cardioversion and 91 of the study group remained in sinus rhythm at day 30. Recurrence of AF was observed in 108 patients at day 30. An optimal cutpoint for NT-proBNP at 500 ng/L predicted recurrence of AF after cardioversion (OR 2.94; 95% CI 1.30-6.63). In multivariate analysis adjusting for age, sex, hypertension, and treatment group strengthened the results (OR 3,56; 95% CI 1,44-8,81). When analysing the ROC curve of NT-proBNP in baseline and atrial fibrillation at day 30 the result was 0.57.\n",
      "Creatine is a naturally occurring substance in the body that is found in high concentrations in the muscles [1]. It is involved in energy metabolism and has been shown to improve athletic performance [2]. There is some evidence to suggest that dietary creatine supplementation may affect some haematological indices, or indices of muscle damage and hepatic and renal function [3]. For example, some studies have found that creatine supplementation can increase the levels of red blood cells and hemoglobin in the blood, which can improve oxygen transport to the muscles [4]. Additionally, some studies have found no significant effects of creatine supplementation on these indices [5]. Overall, while there is some evidence to suggest that creatine supplementation may affect some haematological indices and indices of muscle damage and hepatic and renal function, more research is needed to fully understand the effects of creatine supplementation on these indices [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Creatine is a popular oral supplement in athletes and may have therapeutical potential in neuromuscular diseases. It has been hypothesized that creatine ingestion can lead to increased formation of the carcinogen N-nitrososarcosine.\n[2] The mechanisms behind the positive effects of physical activity on glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle and the time course of the effects need to be more elucidated.\n[3] All measured indices were well within their respective normal range at all times. Serum creatinine concentration tended to be increased the day after Cr supplementation. However, values had returned to baseline six weeks after the cessation of supplementation. These increases were probably attributable to increased creatinine production rather than renal dysfunction. No indication of impairment to the haematological indices measured, hepatic function, or muscle damage was apparent after Cr supplementation.\n[4] This study was undertaken to investigate the influence of oral supplementation with creatine monohydrate on muscular performance during repeated sets of high-intensity resistance exercise.\n[5] Ejection fraction at rest and at work did not change. Performance before creatine supplementation did not differ between placebo and creatine groups. While no change was seen in the placebo group compared to baseline, creatine supplementation increased skeletal muscle total creatine and creatine phosphate by 17 +/- 4% (P < 0.05) and 12 +/- 4% (P < 0.05), respectively. Increments were seen only in patients with < 140 mmol total creatine/kg d.w. (P < 0.05). One-legged performance (21%, P < 0.05), 2-legged performance (10%, P < 0.05), and peak torque, Nm (5%, P < 0.05) increased. Both peak torque and 1-legged performance increased linearly with increased skeletal muscle phosphocreatine (P < 0.05). The increments in 1-legged, 2-legged and peak torque were significant compared to the placebo group, (P < 0.05).\n",
      "Yes, both Epac and PKA are involved in the hepatic cystogenesis of an animal model of ARPKD [1]. Epac (also known as Rap1) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) effector that is activated by cAMP [2]. In ARPKD, mutations in the PKA regulatory subunit gene (PRKG1) lead to increased PKA activity and cAMP production [3]. This, in turn, leads to activation of Epac and other cAMP effectors, which can promote hepatic cystogenesis [0]. PKA, on the other hand, is a protein kinase that is activated by cAMP [4]. In ARPKD, mutations in the PKA regulatory subunit gene (PRKG1) lead to increased PKA activity and cAMP production [2]. This, in turn, leads to activation of PKA and other cAMP effectors, which can promote hepatic cystogenesis [0]. Both Epac and PKA are involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival, and their activation can lead to the formation of cysts in the liver and other organs [5]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] PCK rats, an animal model of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), develop cholangiocyte-derived liver cysts associated with increased intracellular adenosine 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), the inhibition of which suppresses cyst growth. We hypothesized that elevated cAMP stimulates cholangiocyte proliferation via two downstream effectors, exchange proteins activated by cAMP (Epac1 and Epac2 isoforms) and protein kinase A (PKA), and that intracellular calcium is also involved in this process. Assessment of Epac isoforms and PKA regulatory subunits at the messenger RNA and protein level showed that cultured normal rat cholangiocytes express Epac1, Epac2, and all regulatory PKA subunits. Epac isoforms and the PKA RIbeta subunit were overexpressed in cultured PCK cholangiocytes. Proliferation analysis in response to Epac and PKA activation indicated that both normal and PCK cholangiocytes increase their growth upon Epac-specific stimulation, while PKA-specific stimulation results\n[2] In the heart, \u03b2<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic signaling involves cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) acting via both protein kinase-A (PKA) and 'exchange protein directly activated by cAMP' (Epac): a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the small GTPase Rap1. Inhibition of Epac-Rap1 signaling has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy for both cancer and cardiovascular disease. However, previous work suggests that impaired Rap1 signaling may have detrimental effects on cardiac function. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of Epac2-Rap1 signaling on the heart using both in vivo and in vitro approaches.\n[3] The regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) exists in two isoforms, RI and RII, which distinguish the PKA isozymes, type I (PKA-I) and type II (PKA-II). Evidence obtained from a variety of different experimental approaches has shown that the relative levels of type I and type II PKA in cells can play a major role in determining the balance between cell growth and differentiation. In order to characterize the effect of PKA type I and type II regulatory subunits on gene transcription at a global level, the PKA regulatory subunit genes for RIalpha and RIIbeta were stably transfected into cells of the ovarian cancer cell line (OVCAR8).\n[4] In the eukaryotic cell the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is a key enzyme in signal transduction and represents the main target of the second messenger cAMP. Here we describe the design, synthesis and characterisation of specifically tailored cAMP analogs which can be utilised as a tool for affinity enrichment and purification as well as for proteomics based analyses of cAMP binding proteins.\n[5] both normal and PCK cholangiocytes increase their growth upon Epac-specific stimulation, while PKA-specific stimulation results in differential effects, suppressing proliferation in normal cholangiocytes but accelerating this process in PCK cholangiocytes. On the other hand, both PKA and Epac activation of cystic structures generated by normal and PCK cholangiocytes when cultured under three-dimensional conditions resulted in increased cyst growth, particularly in PCK-cholangiocyte derived cysts. Pharmacological inhibitors and small interfering RNA-mediated gene silencing demonstrated the specificity of each effector activation, as well as the involvement of MEK-ERK1/2 signaling in all the observed effector-associated proliferation changes. Hyperproliferation of PCK cholangiocytes in response to PKA stimulation, but not to Epac stimulation, was found to be associated with decreased intracellular calcium, and restoration of calcium levels blocked the PKA-dependent proliferation via the PI3K/AKT pathway.\n",
      "STOP (Synaptic Transporter Of Phosphate) is a protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and learning in the brain [1]. Mutations in the STOP gene have been linked to various neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia [2]. Atypical antipsychotics are a class of drugs that are commonly used to treat schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders [3]. Chronic administration of atypical antipsychotics has been shown to improve behavioral and synaptic defects in STOP null mice [1]. For example, studies have shown that chronic administration of atypical antipsychotics can improve social behavior and cognitive function in these mice [4]. However, the exact mechanism by which atypical antipsychotics improve behavioral and synaptic defects in STOP null mice is not fully understood [1]. It is thought that atypical antipsychotics may modulate the activity of other neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and glutamate, which play important roles in synaptic plasticity and learning [5]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Uptake of glutamate in the hippocampus by specialized transporters appears to be important for the prevention of glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. However, the role of these transporters in synaptic plasticity and learning is still unclear. We examined the expression pattern of glutamate transporters at different stages of spatial learning using a one-day (three blocks) version of the Morris Water Maze.\n[2] Recent studies have suggested that schizophrenia is associated with alterations in the synaptic connectivity involving cytoskeletal proteins. The microtubule-associated protein stable tubule only polypeptide (STOP) plays a key role in neuronal architecture and synaptic plasticity, and it has been demonstrated that STOP gene deletion in mice leads to a phenotype mimicking aspects of positive and negative symptoms and cognitive deficits classically observed in schizophrenic patients. In STOP null mice, behavioral defects are associated with synaptic plasticity abnormalities including defects in long-term potentiation. In these mice, long-term administration of typical antipsychotics has been shown to partially alleviate behavioral defects but, as in humans, such a treatment was poorly active on deficits related to negative symptoms and cognitive impairments. Here, we assessed the effects of risperidone and clozapine, two atypical antipsychotics, on STOP null mice behavior and synaptic plasticity.\n[3] The atypical antipsychotic (APs) drugs have become the most widely used agents to treat a variety of psychoses because of their superiority with regard to safety and tolerability profile compared to conventional/'typical' APs.\n[4] In this study, we examined the effect of aripiprazole on cognitive impairment in mice treated with PCP repeatedly.\n[5] The glutamatergic system may be relevant to the pathophysiology of psychosis and to the effects of antipsychotic treatments.\n",
      "Chlamydia pneumoniae is a bacterium that has been implicated in the development of atherosclerosis, a condition in which the arteries become narrowed and hardened due to the buildup of plaque [1]. Atherosclerotic plaque is a complex mixture of lipids, proteins, and other substances that accumulate on the inner lining of the arteries [2]. In patients with established carotid artery stenosis, which is a narrowing of the arteries that supply blood to the brain, it is not clear whether chlamydia pneumoniae influences the behavior of atherosclerotic plaque [3]. Some studies have suggested that chlamydia pneumoniae may play a role in the development of atherosclerosis, while others have found no evidence of a link [2]. Further research is needed to determine whether chlamydia pneumoniae influences atherosclerotic plaque behavior in patients with established carotid artery stenosis [2]. If a link is found, it could have important implications for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis and related conditions [4]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Chlamydia pneumoniae infection has been associated with atherosclerosis by sero-epidemiological, histopathological and interventional studies, and animal experiments. We hypothesized that if chlamydial infection is causative of atherosclerosis, the occurrence of antibodies against C. pneumoniae should be associated with coronary vasomotor dysfunction - an early sign of atherosclerosis.\n[2] Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by a massive intimal accumulation of low-density lipoprotein that triggers chronic vascular inflammation with an autoimmune response to low-density lipoprotein components.\n[3] Research for infectious agents in the etiology of atherosclerosis has identified Chlamydia pneumoniae as a possible candidate. While there is evidence of an association between presence of this microorganism and atherosclerosis, it is unclear whether infection has a genuinely etiologic role in this disease, whether its presence influences clinical outcomes, and, if so, at which stages of disease this occurs. We have approached this issue in patients with advanced carotid artery atherosclerosis using molecular biological detection methods and clinically relevant indicators of pathology in carotid artery atheroma to determine whether the presence of C pneumoniae correlates with plaque instability.\n[4] Viruses have been identified as one of a variety of potential agents that are implicated in atherogenesis.\n",
      "In rats with colitis, moxibustion has been shown to activate mast cell degranulation at the ST25 point [1]. Mast cells are a type of white blood cell that play a role in the body's immune response [2]. In colitis, the lining of the digestive tract becomes inflamed and damaged, which can lead to a variety of symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss [3]. Mast cells are thought to play a role in the development and progression of colitis by releasing inflammatory mediators such as histamine and cytokines [4]. Moxibustion has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects in the body, which may help to reduce the activity of mast cells and alleviate symptoms of colitis [0]. However, more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of moxibustion on mast cell degranulation and colitis [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] To investigate the effects of moxibustion on the morphology and function of mast cells (MC) at Tianshu (ST25) in rats with trinitro-benzene-sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis.\n[2] Mast cells (MC) are key effector cells of allergic diseases and resistance to helminthic parasites and induce or amplify diverse innate and adaptive immune responses. The signals controlling MC mobilization during inflammation are not fully understood.\n[3] One of the hallmarks of acute colitis is loss of epithelial transport. For unknown reasons, many patients still suffer from GI symptoms during remission, indicating a sustained imbalance between absorption and secretion. We hypothesize that the colonic epithelium becomes more reactive to secretagogues to compensate for a failing barrier.\n[4] The intestinal mucosal immune cells such as the mast cells and eosinophils play an important role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC). The aim of present study was to compare the number of mast cells and eosinophils in patients with active and non-active ulcerative colitis. Another purpose was to found whether the number of eosinophils could correlate with number of mast cells in both tested groups.\n",
      "Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a common type of glaucoma that affects the optic nerve and can lead to vision loss [1]. Some studies have found that ONBF is reduced in eyes of POAG suspects, while others have found no significant difference in ONBF between healthy eyes and eyes with POAG [2]. One possible explanation for the inconsistent findings is that the studies used different methods to measure ONBF [3]. For example, some studies used transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound to measure ONBF, while others used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET) to measure ONBF [4]. Another possible explanation is that the studies included different populations of POAG suspects [5]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is a major cause of late onset visual failure of unknown etiology. Recent genetic association studies have implicated the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene in the pathophysiology of primary open angle glaucoma, but there have been conflicting findings.\n[2] In the patients with OHT or EOAG, F(onh) and RF(onh) were both reduced compared with their respective values in the control group. Both quantities decreased significantly with neuroretinal rim area when the patients' data were pooled. No significant correlation was found between F(onh) or RF(onh) and the other morphometric and functional parameters. The group-averaged time course of RF(onh) was not significantly different from that in the normal subjects.\n[3] Slightly different results were obtained with the two methods, and problems were noted with both methods.\n[4] There is a clinical imperative for noninvasive tests for carotid disease that have high sensitivity. Previous studies have shown that transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) can identify intracranial collateral flow patterns and other hemodynamic consequences of carotid occlusion. We hypothesized that a battery of such TCD findings would have a greater sensitivity than any one TCD finding alone and would have clinical utility in identifying carotid disease.\n[5] The aim of the present study was to clarify this association in this population.\n"

      "\nAnswer: Yes, clove and eugenol in noncytotoxic concentrations exert immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory action on cytokine production by murine macrophages. Clove (100\u00b5g/well) inhibited IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-10 production and exerted an efficient action either before or after LPS challenge for all cytokines. Eugenol did not affect IL-1\u03b2 production but inhibited IL-6 and IL-10 production. The action of eugenol (50 or 100\u00b5g/well) on IL-6 production prevented efficiently effects of LPS either before or after its addition, whereas on IL-10 production it counteracted significantly LPS action when added after LPS incubation.",

In a prospective study of 170 patients requiring PICCs, which were randomized to suture or StatLock securement, the sutureless device was found to significantly reduce complications including dislodgment, infection, occlusion, leakage, and central venous thrombosis.\n\nAdditionally, sutureless anastomosis has been demonstrated to have better hemodynamics at the venous outflow with a supposed reduction of venous neointimal hyperplasia (VNH), which is responsible for outflow stenosis and access thrombosis. This may potentially improve graft patency and reduce complications in patients requiring new self-sealing prosthetic grafts.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, attachment of synovial fibroblasts (SFs) to laminin-111 did not activate the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), but addition of transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) induced a fivefold higher expression of MMP-3. Incubation of SF on laminin-111 in the presence of TGFbeta induced a significant 12-fold higher expression of MMP-3 mRNA, and secretion of MMP-3 was elevated 20-fold above controls. Functional blocking of laminin-111-integrin interaction reduced the laminin-activated MMP-3 expression significantly. Stimulation of SF by laminin-111 and TGFbeta activated the p38MAPK, ERK and SMAD2 pathways, and inhibition of these pathways by using SB203580, PD98059 or A-83-01 confirmed the involvement of these pathways in the regulation of MMP-3.",

      "\nAnswer: The study assessed the effects of early thymoglobulin administration on cardiocyte nuclear status in orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) recipients. The study investigated endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs) from 31 OHT recipients and 10 control cases. OHT patients were divided into the standard group who were treated without thymoglobulin; an ATG group who received thymoglobulin electively, and a standard+ATG group who were administered thymoglobulin upon a drop in renal function. The study evaluated only EMBs obtained at 1 and 4 weeks after OHT showing no significant rejection (ISHLT grades 0 to 1B). The morphometric studies were performed using a computerized, automated Quantimet image analysis system. Overall, 1750 cardiocyte nuclei were quantitated for area, length, breadth, perimeter, chromatin median grey level, and fullness factor. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann- Whitney U test, the Wilcoxon test, and discriminant analysis. However, the question does not provide enough information to determine if thymoglobulin administered early after heart transplantation reduces early myocardial hypertrophy assessed by morphometric studies.",

The maintenance of VEGF-A-induced vessel leakage in the absence of neovascularization at lower ZD6474 doses may be exploited to improve delivery of chemotherapeutic agents in combined treatment regimens of antiangiogenic and chemotherapeutic compounds.",
      "Clove exerted immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting LPS action. A possible mechanism of action probably involved the suppression of the nuclear factor-\u03baB pathway by eugenol, since it was the major compound found in clove extract.",

      "SUB885C, a multi-components preparation, is able to produce anti-atherogenic changes in lipids of the ApoE*3Leiden.CETP mice, which are comparable to those obtained with compounds belonging to known drugs (e.g. rimonabant, atorvastatin, niacin). This study successfully illustrated the power of lipidomics in unraveling intervention effects and to help finding new targets or ingredients for lifestyle-related metabolic abnormality.",
      "Expression of nm23-H1/NDP kinase is strongly upregulated in most EOCs. Redundant overexpression of nm23-H1/NDP kinase may contribute to deranged cell cycle progression and EOC proliferation. Pattern and intensity of nm23-H1/NDP kinase immunostaining of EOC tissue retrieved at primary operation may identify patients at risk for tumor progression and help guide treatment strategies. These findings suggest that nm23-H1 gene expression may have distinct if not opposite biologic functions in EOC and breast carcinoma.",
      "These results suggest that LTB(4) may enhance TNF-alpha-induced CCL27 production by activating NF-kappaB via the BLT1/G(i/o)/PI3K/ERK pathway in human keratinocytes. LTB(4) may contribute to the enhanced CCL27 production of keratinocytes in lesions with atopic dermatitis or allergic contact dermatitis.",

      "In healthy men, NEFA impair insulin-mediated HGU and whole-body glucose uptake to a similar extent. Our data suggest that multiple intracellular NEFA targets may concur to down-regulate glucose uptake by the liver.",
      "OxLDL-specific T cells, present in LDL receptor-/- mice and important contributors in the immune response leading to atherosclerotic plaque, can be counteracted by oxLDL-specific CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ regulatory T cells activated via oral tolerance induction to oxLDL. We conclude that the induction of oral tolerance to oxLDL may be a promising strategy to modulate the immune response during atherogenesis and a new way to treat atherosclerosis.",
      "The expected sex-based less atherogenic lipoprotein cholesterol distribution was not seen in women with type 1 diabetes. Moreover, insulin resistance was associated with a more atherogenic lipoprotein cholesterol distribution in all men and in women with type 1 diabetes. This lipoprotein cholesterol distribution may contribute to sex-based differences in CVD in type 1 diabetes.",

      "Rosuvastatin is effective in preventing LV remodelling and dysfunction in the failing heart. The molecular mechanism may be related to normalization of SERCA2a expression, SERCA activity, and pSer16-PLB levels, as well as through cytokine alterations independent of its lipid-lowering effect.",
      "EAC guidelines were safe, effective, and practically implemented in a level 1 trauma center. During the resuscitation course, increased exposure to acidosis was associated with a higher complication rate. Identifying the innate differences in the response, regulation, and resolution of acidosis in these critically injured patients is an important area for trauma research.",

      "We found that DcR3 was overexpressed in pancreatic head carcinoma. The patients with high DcR3 levels had higher pN2 stages than those with low DcR3 levels. Detecting serum DcR3 level preoperatively might be an additional approach for evaluating pN2 stage and guiding the range of lymphadenectomy.",

      "In conclusion, these findings indicate that long-term regular participation in sport and leisure activities categorized according to an osteogenic index [but not the total time (min) spent participating in all sport and leisure activities] was an important determinant of bone size, quality and strength, but not BMD, at loaded sites in older men. Furthermore, continued participation in weight-bearing exercise in early to mid-adulthood appears to be important for reducing the risk of low bone strength in old age.",
      "Unlike in mild and relatively early STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy, scarring of severely and chronically damaged kidneys is not attenuated by a 50% reduction of CCN2 to (near) normal levels. This suggests that CCN2 is either redundant in severe and chronic kidney disease, or that it is a limiting factor only at subnormal concentrations requiring further reduction by available or emerging therapies to prevent fibrosis of the severely injured kidney.",
      "Severity of hepatic encephalopathy (particularly with respect to static ataxia and fine motor control) is associated with posttransplantation improvement in quality of life.",

      "Attachment of SF to LM-111 by itself has only minor effects on the expression of MMP-1 or MMP-3, but it facilitates the TGFbeta-induced expression of MMP-3 significantly. This mode of MMP-3 induction may therefore contribute to inflammatory joint destruction in RA independent of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)1beta or tumour necrosis factor (TNF)alpha.",

      "A confirmation of the hypothesis would support efforts to generate a P. falciparum vaccine containing a comprehensive set of blood stage antigens, which, using adjuvant technology, would lead to the appropriate immunoglobulin subclass response. MEANS TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS: Detection of multiple immunorelevant P. falciparum blood stage antigens could be achieved by two-dimensional electrophoresis and blotting of the antigens onto nitrocellulose followed by exposure to the participant's serum. Bound immunoglobulins are visualized by isotype specific peroxidase conjugated anti-human immunoglobulin and quantified by transmission densitometry. The resulting pattern of responses for each immunoglobulin isotype could be compared between clinically immune participants remaining asymptomatic with subsequent P. falciparum infections and people who develop malaria. Immunorelevant antigens are identifiable by mass spectrometry with the fully decoded P. falciparum genome.",
      "Results indicated that the involvement of multiple recombination detection programs is very necessary. Additionally, results suggested two major challenges, one involving the difficulty of accurately determining the locations of breakpoints and the second involving identification of small regions of about 200 bases or fewer with greater caution. Both indicate the complexity of HIV-1 recombination. The resolution would depend critically on development of a recombination analysis algorithm, accumulation of HIV-1 stains, and a higher sequencing quality. With the changes in recombination pattern, phylogenetic relationships of some CRFs may also change. All these results may be critical to understand the role of recombination in a complex and dynamic HIV evolution.",

      "In this population, which included a high percentage of patients with luminal cancers, pCR did not predict for improved OS. Postneoadjuvant chemotherapy showed no discernible benefit even in subgroups with aggressive tumor biology or significant remaining tumor burden. The use of such treatment should therefore be discouraged outside of clinical trials.",

      "In this study, we find that simple and complex ASEs undergo opposite selection pressure for protein reading frame preservation, with CSEs in-between. Simple ASEs have much higher FRFPs than complex ones. We further find that the FRFPs of complex ASEs coupled with flanking exons are close to those of simple ASEs, indicating that neighboring exons of an ASE may evolve in a coordinated way to avoid protein dysfunction. Therefore, we suggest that evolutionary analyses of AS should take into consideration the effects of different splicing patterns and the joint effects of multiple AS events.",
      "Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that HDGF was expressed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. High nuclear expression of HDGF was positively correlated with FIGO stage (P = 0.032), but not associated with other clinical features, such as histological grading or lymph node status. Patients with high expression of HDGF had poorer overall survival rates than those with low expression of HDGF (P = 0.001). However, multivariate analyses showed that high nuclear expression of HDGF protein was not an independent predictor of prognosis for EC patients (P = 0.111). Our results suggest that high nuclear expression of HDGF is a potential unfavorable factor for the progression and prognosis of EC.",
      "The results of our large, single-center, retrospective study suggest that the findings of a FDG-PET scan may be interesting in the initial assessment of patients with ECD, but its greater contribution is in followup of these patients.",

      "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading known genetic cause of autism spectrum disorders. Individuals with FXS show symptoms of auditory hypersensitivity. These symptoms may arise due to sustained neural responses to repeated sounds, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. For the first time, this study shows deficits in habituation of neural responses to repeated sounds in the Fmr1 KO mice as seen in humans with FXS. We also report an abnormally high level of matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) in the auditory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice and that deletion of Mmp-9 from Fmr1 KO mice reverses habituation deficits. These data provide a translation relevant electrophysiological biomarker for sensory deficits in FXS and implicate MMP-9 as a target for drug discovery.",

      "These findings indicate that NGAL reduces apoptosis by regulating the four apoptosis factors Bcl-2, Bax, Fas and FasL through its two receptors 24p3R and megalin. These results also suggest that ectopic expression of NGAL in renal cells might provide a therapeutic strategy in ischemia-reperfusion by reducing apoptosis and promoting renal cell proliferation.",
      "Increased BMI is associated with increased diurnal strains in articular cartilage of both the medial and lateral compartments of the knee.

Oxytocin does not seem to play a role in the diurnal urine formation, whereas prostaglandin E2 could represent a mediator of the gender difference, not only as a mediator of the vasopressin response, but also as an independent factor. These findings need further elucidation.",
