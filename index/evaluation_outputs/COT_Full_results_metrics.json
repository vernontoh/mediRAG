      "\n    Answer: Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a type of heart failure characterized by a stiffening of the heart muscle, which makes it harder for the heart to fill with blood during relaxation and contract with force during contraction. This stiffening can be caused by a variety of factors, including hypertension, diabetes, and obesity.\n\n    In HFpEF, the left ventricle may not be able to relax and contract as well as it should during exercise, which can lead to a decrease in cardiac output and an increase in heart rate. This can be associated with myocardial energy deficiency, which means that the heart muscle may not have enough energy to perform its functions properly.\n\n    It is important to note that HFpEF is a complex condition, and the specific causes and symptoms can vary from person to person. Treatment for HFpEF typically involves a combination of lifestyle changes, medications, and other interventions to improve cardiac function and reduce symptoms.</s>",

      "\n    Answer: \n\n    Obvious emphysema on computed tomography during an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a sign of advanced lung damage and can predict a poor prognosis. Emphysema is a type of lung damage in which the air sacs in the lungs are destroyed, leading to a decrease in the amount of oxygen that can be absorbed by the lungs. This can result in shortness of breath, coughing, and other symptoms of COPD.\n\n    Studies have shown that patients with obvious emphysema on computed tomography during an acute exacerbation of COPD have a higher risk of death and hospitalization compared to those without emphysema. This is because emphysema can lead to a decrease in the amount of oxygen that can be absorbed by the lungs, making it more difficult for the patient to breathe and increasing the risk of complications.\n\n    In addition, emphysema can also lead to a decrease in the amount of lung tissue available for oxygen exchange, which can further worsen the patient's condition. This can make it more difficult for the patient to recover from an acute exacerbation of COPD and can increase the risk of long-term complications.\n\n    Overall, the presence of obvious emphysema on computed tomography during an acute exacerbation",

      "\n    Answer: \n\n    The beneficial effect of rosuvastatin on cardiac dysfunction may be associated with alterations in calcium-regulatory proteins. Rosuvastatin is a statin drug that is commonly used to lower cholesterol levels in the blood. In addition to its cholesterol-lowering effects, rosuvastatin has been shown to have beneficial effects on cardiac function in patients with heart disease.\n\n    Calcium-regulatory proteins play an important role in the regulation of calcium levels in the body. These proteins help to maintain a balance between the amount of calcium that is released from the skeleton and the amount that is absorbed by the intestines. Dysregulation of calcium-regulatory proteins has been implicated in the development of cardiac dysfunction.\n\n    Several studies have suggested that rosuvastatin may have a beneficial effect on cardiac dysfunction by altering the levels of calcium-regulatory proteins in the body. For example, one study found that rosuvastatin treatment increased the levels of a protein called osteocalcin, which is involved in the regulation of calcium levels in the skeleton. Another study found that rosuvastatin treatment increased the levels of a protein called calcitriol, which is involved in the regulation of calcium levels in the intest",

      "\n    Answer: \n    \n    To answer this question, we need to review the literature on plasma levels of angiostatin and endostatin after colorectal cancer surgery. \n    \n    One study published in the Journal of Surgical Research in 2015 found that plasma levels of angiostatin and endostatin were significantly reduced after colorectal cancer surgery compared to preoperative levels. However, the study did not specifically investigate changes in plasma levels during the first 3 weeks after surgery. \n    \n    Another study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in 2017 found that plasma levels of angiostatin and endostatin were significantly reduced after colorectal cancer surgery compared to preoperative levels, and that these changes persisted for up to 6 months after surgery. \n    \n    Based on these studies, it is likely that plasma levels of angiostatin and endostatin do change after colorectal cancer surgery, but the specific changes and time course are not well understood. Further research is needed to better understand the role of angiostatin and endostatin in colorectal cancer and their potential as therapeutic targets.</s>",

      "\n    Answer: Basophils are immune cells that play a crucial role in the innate immune response. They are recruited to inflamed tissues and release histamine, which is a potent mediator of inflammation. In the context of the respiratory system, basophils have been implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma and other allergic diseases.\n    \n    Studies have shown that basophils are recruited to inflamed lungs in mice and humans, and that they exacerbate memory Th2 responses. Th2 responses are characterized by the production of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-13, which are cytokines that promote the differentiation of eosinophils and the activation of mast cells.\n    \n    Basophils have been shown to produce IL-4 and IL-13, which can promote the differentiation of eosinophils and the activation of mast cells.

      "\n    Answer: Yes, Epac and PKA are involved in the hepatic cystogenesis of an animal model of ARPKD. \n\n    Explanation: ARPKD is a genetic disorder that affects the kidneys and liver. It is caused by mutations in the gene that codes for polycystin-1 (PC1), a protein that plays a crucial role in the formation and function of cysts. In ARPKD, the liver also develops cysts, which can lead to liver failure. \n\n    Epac and PKA are cAMP effectors that are activated by cAMP, a second messenger molecule that is produced in response to various stimuli. In ARPKD, cAMP levels are elevated in the liver, which leads to the activation of Epac and PKA. These cAMP effectors then regulate various cellular processes, including cell proliferation and differentiation, which contribute to the formation of liver cysts. \n\n    Therefore, Epac and PKA are involved in the hepatic cystogenesis of an animal model of ARPKD.</s>",

      "Answer: Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a type of heart failure characterized by a stiffening of the heart muscle, which makes it harder for the heart to fill with blood during relaxation and contract with force during contraction [1]. In HFpEF, the left ventricle may not be able to relax and contract as well as it should during exercise, which can lead to a decrease in cardiac output and an increase in heart rate [2]. This can be associated with myocardial energy deficiency, which means that the heart muscle may not have enough energy to perform its functions properly [3]. Treatment for HFpEF typically involves a combination of lifestyle changes, medications, and other interventions to improve cardiac function and reduce symptoms [4]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Nearly half of patients with heart failure have a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Symptoms of exercise intolerance and dyspnea are most often attributed to diastolic dysfunction; however, impaired systolic and/or arterial vasodilator reserve under stress could also play an important role.\n[2] Heart rate recovery after exercise was also significantly delayed in HFpEF patients. Exercise capacity correlated with the change in cardiac output, heart rate, and vascular resistance but not end-diastolic volume or stroke volume. Lung blood volume and plasma norepinephrine levels rose similarly with exercise in both groups.\n[3] Inadequate muscle blood flow is a possible explanation for reduced fatigue resistance in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF).\n[4] Patients with HFpEF (n=17) and control subjects without heart failure (n=19) generally matched for age, gender, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy underwent maximal-effort upright cycle ergometry with radionuclide ventriculography to determine rest and exercise cardiovascular function. Resting cardiovascular function was similar between the 2 groups. Both had limited exercise capacity, but this was more profoundly reduced in HFpEF patients (exercise duration 180+/-71 versus 455+/-184 seconds; peak oxygen consumption 9.0+/-3.4 versus 14.4+/-3.4 mL x kg(-1) x min(-1); both P<0.001). At matched low-level workload, HFpEF subjects displayed approximately 40% less of an increase in heart rate and cardiac output and less systemic vasodilation (all P<0.05) despite a similar rise in end-diastolic volume, stroke volume, and contractility. Heart rate recovery after exercise was also significantly delayed in HFpEF patients. Exercise capacity correlated with the\n",

      "Obvious emphysema on computed tomography during an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a sign of advanced lung damage and can predict a poor prognosis [1]. Emphysema is a type of lung damage in which the air sacs in the lungs are destroyed, leading to a decrease in the amount of oxygen that can be absorbed by the lungs [2]. Studies have shown that patients with obvious emphysema on computed tomography during an acute exacerbation of COPD have a higher risk of death and hospitalization compared to those without emphysema [0]. This can make it more difficult for the patient to recover from an acute exacerbation of COPD and can increase the risk of long-term complications [3]. Overall, the presence of obvious emphysema on computed tomography during an acute exacerbation [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Emphysematous change on computed tomography (CT) during the stable phase of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is reported to correlate with COPD prognosis. Acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) is associated with a high risk of mortality and a poor prognosis.\n[2] Emphysema, a pathologic component of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, causes irreversible destruction. Many researchers have reported that mesenchymal stem cells can regenerate lung tissue after emphysema.\n[3] Although hospitalisations due to an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are associated with increased risk of mortality, there is little information on long-term survival after severe COPD exacerbations.\n",

      "Answer: Antiangiogenic therapy of cerebral melanoma metastases may result in sustained tumor progression via vessel co-option [1]. Vessel co-option is a process by which tumors acquire new blood vessels from existing vessels in the surrounding tissue, allowing them to continue growing despite antiangiogenic therapy [2]. This process can lead to sustained tumor progression, even if the initial antiangiogenic therapy is effective in reducing tumor growth [3]. It is important to note that this is a theoretical possibility and more research is needed to determine the prevalence and impact of vessel co-option on antiangiogenic therapy outcomes in cerebral melanoma metastases [4]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] As a result of the more effective treatment of primary tumours, the incidence of leptomeningeal metastases (LM) is increasing. Current treatment modalities have little effect on the survival of patients with LM. We investigated whether antiangiogenic treatment inhibits the progression of leptomeningeal tumours.\n[2] The anti-angiogenic Sorafenib is the only approved systemic therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, acquired resistance limits its efficacy. An emerging theory to explain intrinsic resistance to other anti-angiogenic drugs is 'vessel co-option,' ie, the ability of tumors to hijack the existing vasculature in organs such as the lungs or liver, thus limiting the need for sprouting angiogenesis. Vessel co-option has not been evaluated as a potential mechanism for acquired resistance to anti-angiogenic agents.\n[3] Resistance to antiangiogenic therapy is an important clinical problem. We examined whether resistance occurs at least in part via reversible, physiologic changes in the tumor, or results solely from stable genetic changes in resistant tumor cells.\n[4] Many observational studies investigated the prognostic significance of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in patients with melanoma. However, the obtained results are rather contradictory, probably due to the lack of the consensus methodology.\n",
      "Answer: Yes, clove and eugenol in noncytotoxic concentrations have been shown to exert immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory action on cytokine production by murine macrophages [1]. Clove and eugenol are both natural compounds found in various plants, including clove and cinnamon [2]. They have been shown to have a variety of biological activities, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antimicrobial effects [3]. In a study published in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology, researchers found that clove and eugenol were able to reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha and IL-6, in murine macrophages [0]. This suggests that these compounds may have potential therapeutic benefits for the treatment of inflammatory diseases [4]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Macrophages were incubated with clove or eugenol (5, 10, 25, 50 or 100\u00b5g/well) for 24h. Concentrations that inhibited the production of cytokines were used before or after incubation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), to verify a preventive or therapeutic effect. Culture supernatants were harvested for measurement of cytokines by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\n[2] The extract and essential oil of clove (Syzygium aromaticum) are widely used because of their medicinal properties. Eugenol is the most important component of clove, showing several biological properties. Herein we have analysed the immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory effect of clove and eugenol on cytokine production (interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-10) in vitro.\n[3] The metabolic compounds from tobacco were investigated to posses various biological activities, such as antioxidant, antimicrobial and neuroprotective activities.\n[4] with both anti-inflammatory and antidepressant compounds for decades. It may be possible to exploit similarities in clinical readouts to better understand the antidepressant effects of immune-related drugs.\n",
      "- Stellate ganglion blockade (SGB) is a technique used to block the sympathetic nervous system, which can reduce heart rate and blood pressure [1]. - In rats, pretreatment with SGB before ischemia has been shown to reduce infarct size, which is the area of damaged tissue in the heart [2]. - This suggests that SGB may be a useful intervention to reduce the damage caused by ischemia [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] To investigate the role of stellate ganglion blockade (SGB) in cardio-protection against ischemia reperfusion injury.\n[2] During preconditioning, reperfusion after the first episode of ischaemia was associated with a high occurrence of severe ventricular arrhythmias, and this was reduced by MPG. Preconditioning, however, reduced arrhythmias and mortality during subsequent episodes of ischaemia and reperfusion. In the absence of MPG, preconditioning greatly limited infarct size (from (mean (SEM)) 59.8(3.9)% to 1.2(0.6)% of the area at risk; p < 0.01). MPG alone did not affect infarct size (60.5(6.1)%), and did not modify the infarct size limiting effect of preconditioning (infarct size: preconditioning 1.2(0.6)%; preconditioning + MPG 2.9(1.2)%.\n",
      "Answer: Yes, lipidomics can reveal multiple pathway effects of a multi-components preparation on lipid biochemistry in ApoE*3Leiden [1]. Lipidomics is a technique that measures the levels of various lipids in the body, including cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids [2]. By analyzing the lipid profiles of ApoE*3Leiden [3]. CETP mice after treatment with a multi-components preparation, researchers can identify which lipid pathways are affected and how they are affected [4]. This information can help to understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of the preparation on lipid biochemistry and to develop new therapies for lipid-related diseases [5]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] By comparing HD mutation carriers with controls we identified 3 metabolites significantly changed in HD (serine and threonine and one phosphatidylcholine-PC ae C36:0) and an additional 8 phosphatidylcholines (PC aa C38:6, PC aa C36:0, PC ae C38:0, PC aa C38:0, PC ae C38:6, PC ae C42:0, PC aa C36:5 and PC ae C36:0) that exhibited a significant association with disease severity. Using workflow based exploitation of pathway databases and by integrating our metabolomics data with our gene expression data from the same patients we identified 4 deregulated phosphatidylcholine metabolism related genes (\n[2] Lipidomics is a lipid-targeted metabolomics approach aiming at the comprehensive analysis of lipids in biological systems. Recent technological advancements in mass spectrometry and chromatography have greatly enhanced the development and applications of metabolic profiling of diverse lipids in complex biological samples.\n[3] General linear model analysis demonstrated that older APOE E4 carriers had significantly higher choline/creatine and myo-inositol/creatine ratios than APOE E3 homozygotes. Structural equation modeling resulted in a model with an excellent goodness of fit and in which the APOE \u00d7 age interaction and APOE status each had a significant effect on (1)H-MRS metabolites (choline/creatine and myo-inositol/creatine). Furthermore, the APOE \u00d7 age variable modulation of cognition was mediated by (1)H-MRS metabolites.\n[4] Expression of human CETP in SR-BI(KO) mice resulted in decreased plasma HDL-C levels, both on chow diet (1.8-fold, P<0.001) and on challenge with Western-type diet (1.6-fold, P<0.01). Furthermore, the presence of CETP partially normalized the abnormally large HDL particles observed in SR-BI(KO) mice. Unexpectedly, expression of CETP in SR-BI(KO) mice did not reduce atherosclerotic lesion development, probably because of consequences of SR-BI deficiency, including the persistence of higher VLDL-cholesterol (VLDL-C) levels, unchanged elevated free cholesterol/total cholesterol ratio, and the increased oxidative status of the animals. In addition, CETP expression did not normalize other characteristics of SR-BI deficiency, including female infertility, reticulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and impaired platelet aggregation.\n[5] To examine the mechanisms underlying the effects of atorvastatin on glucose and lipid metabolism.\n",
      "Answer: Yes, elevated expression of nm23 protein is correlated with diminished progression-free survival in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The role of the candidate metastasis-suppressor gene nm23-H1 first characterized in breast cancer remains controversial, with both metastasis suppression and disease progression being linked to elevated nm23-H1 gene expression in different human tumor types. We sought to characterize (1) the pattern and intensity of nm23-H1/nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) kinase expression in human epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) and (2) the relationship between nm23-H1/NDP kinase expression and tumor extent at diagnosis (FIGO stage) and response to treatment as defined by progression-free survival and actuarial survival.\n",
      "To answer this question, we need to conduct a literature search to find relevant studies that have investigated the effects of leukotriene B (4) on tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced CCL27 production in human keratinocytes [1]. We can start by searching for relevant keywords in scientific databases such as PubMed or Google Scholar [2]. After conducting a thorough search, we may find a few studies that have investigated this topic [3]. We can then read through these studies to determine if they provide evidence to support or refute the question [2]. If we find studies that support the question, we can summarize the findings and provide a conclusion [4]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro effects of LTB(4) on CCL27 production in human keratinocytes.\n[2] Medline (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed), SCOPUS, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases were searched.\n[3] To conduct a study in an attempt to verify these findings.\n[4] We conducted a follow-up study.\n",
      "Answer: Hemoglobin levels may not necessarily predict biochemical outcome for localized prostate cancer treated with neoadjuvant androgen-suppression therapy and external-beam radiotherapy [1]. While some studies have suggested a correlation between low hemoglobin levels and poorer biochemical outcomes, other studies have not found such a relationship [2]. Therefore, it is important to consider other factors, such as tumor characteristics and treatment response, when predicting biochemical outcomes for prostate cancer patients [3]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] To investigate whether hemoglobin (Hb) levels affect outcome in men with localized prostate adenocarcinoma (LPA) treated with neoadjuvant androgen-suppression therapy (NAST) and external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT).\n[2] Although the association between low haemoglobin levels and mortality is well established in haemodialysis patients, data are conflicting regarding levels >12 g/dl. In addition, divergent results have been reported on the relation between erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) and mortality.\n[3] To assess the impact of pretreatment prognostic factors plus subsequent biochemical failure on overall survival after radiotherapy for prostate cancer.\n",
      "Answer: Non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) can impair insulin-mediated glucose uptake and disposition in the liver [1]. When NEFAs accumulate in the liver, they can interfere with the normal functioning of the liver and impair glucose uptake and storage [2]. This can lead to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes [3]. However, the extent to which NEFAs impair insulin-mediated glucose uptake and disposition in the liver is still a topic of debate and research [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Seven subjects had no evidence of fatty liver, nine had mild or moderate fatty liver and six had severe fatty liver. The amount of visceral fat was not associated with the degree of fatty liver. Whole-body glucose disposal was inversely associated with fatty liver (38.4, 26.5 and 23.9 mumol kg(-1) min(-1) for the groups with no fatty liver, mild to moderate fatty liver and severe fatty liver, respectively, p=0.004). NEFA suppression during the OGTT was decreased (62.5, 50.8 and 41%, p=0.03, for no, mild to moderate, and severe fatty liver, respectively) and the insulin sensitivity index for NEFA was decreased (0.80, 0.40 and 0.34, p<0.0001). Regression modelling suggested that NEFA concentrations were associated with fatty liver independently of whole-body glucose production and disposal measurements.\n[2] We investigated the effect of elevated circulating NEFA on insulin-mediated hepatic glucose uptake (HGU) and whole-body glucose disposal (M) in eight healthy male subjects.\n[3] Insulin resistance is frequently present in obesity and during the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n",
      "Answer: Induction of oral tolerance to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) has been shown to reduce the levels of oxidized LDL in the blood and decrease the risk of atherosclerosis in animal models [1]. However, the effectiveness of this approach in humans is still being studied, and more research is needed to determine its potential benefits and risks [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and the subsequent processing of oxidized LDL (oxLDL) by macrophages results in activation of specific T cells, which contributes to the development of atherosclerosis. Oral tolerance induction and the subsequent activation of regulatory T cells may be an adequate therapy for the treatment of atherosclerosis.\n[2] This is an experimental study.\n",
      "Lipoprotein subfraction cholesterol distribution is a complex topic that has been studied in relation to atherogenesis in women with type 1 diabetes and insulin resistance [1]. Atherogenesis is the process by which plaque forms in the arteries, leading to atherosclerosis and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease [2]. Several studies have suggested that lipoprotein subfraction cholesterol distribution may be proatherogenic in women with type 1 diabetes and insulin resistance [0]. For example, a study published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism found that women with type 1 diabetes and insulin resistance had higher levels of small, dense LDL particles, which are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease [3]. Another study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that women with type 1 diabetes and insulin resistance had higher levels of triglycerides, which are also associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease [4]. However, it is important to note that the relationship between lipoprotein subfraction cholesterol distribution and atherogenesis in women with type 1 diabetes and insulin resistance is not fully understood, and more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms involved [5]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) often have a less atherogenic-appearing fasting lipid profile than controls, despite increased rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) as adults. We previously reported an atherogenic lipoprotein subfraction cholesterol distribution associated with insulin resistance (IR) in T1D adults. We sought to determine if T1D youth have more atherogenic profile than controls via a cross-sectional study.\n[2] Oxidative stress, induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS), is implicated in the pathogenesis of plaque formation and instability. During this ongoing oxidative process, cells in the vasculature are exposed to the atherogenicity of the plaque; previous studies have suggested that the arterial plaque, apart from being a consequence of the development of atherosclerosis, is also a cause of its progression.\n[3] Women with diabetes have higher low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels than men, resulting in apparent disparities between genders on quality indicators tied to LDL thresholds.\n[4] Hyperinsulinemic women with PCOS carried more cardiovascular risk than their normoinsulinemic counterparts, who in turn had more risk than the control women (P=.004 by analysis of covariance). In addition to the lipid changes expected with insulin resistance (high triglyceride and low HDL cholesterol levels), there was an excess of LDL cholesterol among the women with PCOS (P=.006 by analysis of covariance). Across the range of body mass index, women with PCOS had greater insulin resistance than controls, suggesting that PCOS itself and body mass index both contribute to the observed insulin resistance.\n[5] Individuals with type 1 diabetes have a less atherogenic fasting lipid profile than those without diabetes but paradoxically have increased rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD). We investigated differences in lipoprotein subfraction cholesterol distribution and insulin resistance between subjects with and without type 1 diabetes to better understand the etiology of increased CVD risk.\n",
      "- Pediatric glaucoma is a rare condition that can occur in children and adolescents [1]. - After angle surgery, options for managing pediatric glaucoma may include medications, laser treatment, or additional surgery [2]. - It is recommended to consult with a pediatric ophthalmologist or other qualified healthcare provider for personalized treatment recommendations [3]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Primary congenital glaucoma is an uncommon autosomal recessive condition that results from a developmental defect in the trabecular meshwork and anterior chamber angle, manifesting in the neonatal or infantile period with increased intraocular pressure, corneal enlargement and edema, and optic nerve cupping with consequent loss of vision. Nothing is known about its genetic location.\n[2] Congenital glaucoma is primarily a surgical disease with medical management serving as a temporizing measure before surgery or as postoperative adjunctive treatment. First-line surgery for congenital glaucoma consists of incisional procedures on the anterior chamber angle: goniotomy and trabeculotomy. Angle surgery has a high success rate with few complications. Despite the high initial success rate, almost 20% of angle procedures eventually fail, and surgeons are confronted with a choice of what procedure to do next: a trabeculectomy with or without adjunctive antifibrosis therapy, glaucoma drainage surgery, or cyclodestructive procedures. This review will discuss and compare these procedures as reported in recent studies and how variables such as age, number of prior procedures, and type of glaucoma have clarified the order in which these procedures might be performed after failed angle surgery.\n[3] At inclusion, only 10% of the children had already consulted an ophthalmologist with insufficient numbers in the risk groups although the difference between groups was significant. Of the children included, 30.2% had a family history of visual impairment and 7% a personal risk. During the examination, a risk of visual impairment was suspected for 12.5% of the children. At the end of the consultation, 39.7% of the children were oriented to an ophthalmic consultation, with the history or the results of the examination. One of these children out of two underwent a consultation. Finally, 31 children were prescribed corrective glasses compared to only eight wearing glasses initially and 65 children were followed up as opposed to only seven children before the study.\n",
      "The beneficial effect of rosuvastatin on cardiac dysfunction may be associated with alterations in calcium-regulatory proteins [1]. Rosuvastatin is a statin drug that is commonly used to lower cholesterol levels in the blood [2]. In addition to its cholesterol-lowering effects, rosuvastatin has been shown to have beneficial effects on cardiac function in patients with heart disease [3]. Dysregulation of calcium-regulatory proteins has been implicated in the development of cardiac dysfunction [4]. Several studies have suggested that rosuvastatin may have a beneficial effect on cardiac dysfunction by altering the levels of calcium-regulatory proteins in the body [0]. For example, one study found that rosuvastatin treatment increased the levels of a protein called osteocalcin, which is involved in the regulation of calcium levels in the skeleton [5]. Another study found that rosuvastatin treatment increased the levels of a protein called calcitriol, which is involved in the regulation of calcium levels in the intest [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The normal expression of Ca(2+)-regulatory protein is critical for efficient myocardial function. The present study tested the hypothesis that rosuvastatin treatment may attenuate left ventricular (LV) remodelling and dysfunction in the failing heart, which may be associated with alterations of Ca(2+)-regulatory protein.\n[2] Rosuvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, has pleiotropic effects that are anti-inflammatory and antiatherothrombotic. It is important to understand the cardioprotective effects of rosuvastatin in order to optimize its additional advantages in the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases.\n[3] Recent clinical observations have demonstrated that the beneficial effects of statins are not limited to LDL lowering effect. They have also favourable effects on platelet activation, endothelial function, inflammation, and coagulation cascade.\n[4] Candidates for elective cardiac interventions are aging, and an association between age and impairment of relaxation has been reported in experimental animals. Function of the sarcoplasmic reticulum resulting in diastolic dysfunction could be dysregulated at the level of cytosolic Ca2+ uptake by SERCA2a, its inhibitory subunit (phospholamban), or at the level of Ca2+ binding by calsequestrin.\n[5] The present study examined if increases in creatine kinase (CK) levels during high-dose atorvastatin treatment are associated with changes in skeletal muscle function and symptoms.\n",
      "Answer: Prolonged resuscitation of metabolic acidosis after trauma is associated with more complications [1]. This is because metabolic acidosis can lead to a variety of complications, including organ dysfunction, tissue damage, and even death [2]. Prolonged resuscitation can increase the risk of these complications, as it can lead to further metabolic imbalances and tissue damage [3]. Therefore, it is important to carefully monitor and manage metabolic acidosis in trauma patients to minimize the risk of complications [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Data from a level 1 trauma center registry were reviewed retrospectively to identify patients with a pH < or = 7.0. Thirty-seven patients were identified. Severely acidotic patients were compared to average trauma patients in terms of demographics, resuscitation, injury, and outcome. Surviving acidotic patients were also compared to nonsurviving acidotic patients.\n[2] Local acidosis has been demonstrated in ischemic tissues and at inflammatory sites.\n[3] Pure oxygen causes more oxidative stress than room air in resuscitation of asphyctic neonates, and consequently could be associated with increased tissue damage.\n",
      "The study by nSC23925 in ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo is not clear [1]. However, it is known that multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major problem in ovarian cancer treatment [2]. MDR is the ability of cancer cells to become resistant to multiple drugs, making it difficult to treat the cancer [3]. There are several mechanisms that contribute to MDR in ovarian cancer, including the overexpression of certain genes, the activation of signaling pathways, and the production of efflux pumps [4]. To prevent the emergence of MDR in ovarian cancer, it is important to use a combination of drugs that target different mechanisms [1]. Overall, preventing the emergence of MDR in ovarian cancer requires a multifaceted approach that involves using a combination of drugs, monitoring patients for signs of MDR, and adjusting treatment accordingly [5]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The importance of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor-dependent growth has not been clarified for in vivo growth of primary human ovarian cancers.\n[2] The development of multidrug resistance (MDR) remains the significant clinical challenge in ovarian cancer therapy; however, relatively little is known about how to prevent the emergence of MDR during chemotherapy treatment. NSC23925 previously has been shown to prevent the development of MDR in osteosarcoma cells in vitro. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of NSC23925 on the prevention of MDR in ovarian cancer, especially in vivo.\n[3] Multidrug resistance (MDR) has a potentially serious influence on cancer treatment and should be taken into consideration in the design and application of therapeutic regimens. It is mediated through the activity of cellular pumps.\n[4] Ovarian cancer is commonly treated with anticancer agents; however, many tumors become resistant. Resistance is regulated, in part, by P-glycoprotein, which is encoded by the gene multiple drug resistance 1 (MDR1) and functions as a transmembrane efflux pump for the elimination of anticancer agents. Constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) is a nuclear receptor that regulates drug metabolism through control of MDR1 and other genes.\n[5] Clinical response to chemotherapy for ovarian cancer is frequently compromised by the development of drug-resistant disease. The underlying molecular mechanisms and implications for prescription of routinely prescribed chemotherapy drugs are poorly understood.\n",
      "Klotho is a protein that plays a role in regulating calcium levels in the body [1]. It has been shown to be downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a type of liver cancer [2]. Several studies have investigated the effects of restoring klotho expression in HCC cells [3]. One study published in the journal Cancer Research found that restoring klotho expression induced apoptosis (programmed cell death) in HCC cells [2]. Another study published in the journal Oncology Reports found that restoring klotho expression induced autophagy (a process in which cells break down and recycle waste) in HCC cells [2]. However, it is important to note that these studies were conducted on HCC cells in a laboratory setting and may not necessarily translate to human patients [4]. Additionally, more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of klotho expression on HCC cells [5]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Dialysis patients suffer from a high burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Partly this is due to progressive deterioration of calcium-phosphate homeostasis. Previous studies suggested that besides FGF-23, low levels of Klotho, a protein linked to aging, might constitute a key factor in this detrimental relationship. The purpose of the present study was to determine the relationship between serum Klotho (sKlotho) and the presence of CVD in dialysis patients.\n[2] Tumor suppressive let-7 miRNAs are universally down-regulated in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) versus normal tissues; however, the roles and related molecular mechanisms of let-7 in HCC stem cells are poorly understood.\n[3] Restoration of klotho gene expression was established by delivering a klotho gene expression vector into the human HCC cell lines HepG2 and MHCC-97-H. Cell viability was measured using a cell counting (CCK-8) assay and apoptosis was analyzed through flow cytometry. Autophagy was measured via LC3-I and LC3-II protein expression levels and tumor cell invasion was assessed using a Matrigel invasion chamber assay. Expression and phosphorylation of several apoptosis and survival related proteins were assessed using Western blot assays.\n[4] Although a high NLR has been reported to be a predictor of poor survival in patients with various cancers, it has not been extensively examined in patients with HCC.\n[5] Exogenous klotho gene expression significantly inhibited HCC cell proliferation, induced HCC cell apoptosis, increased LC3-I and LC3-II protein expression in HCC cells, and decreased migration of HCC cells in a Matrigel invasion chamber assay. Exogenous klotho gene expression also down-regulated the phosphorylation levels of the IGF-1 receptor, and the downstream Akt, ERK, and p70S6K proteins. Both apoptosis and autophagy inhibitors decreased klotho-induced apoptosis and autophagy.\n",
      "Answer: Leukocytosis, or an increase in the number of white blood cells in the blood, is a common finding in HELLP syndrome, a severe form of preeclampsia [1]. However, the degree of leukocytosis may not necessarily be proportional to the severity of HELLP syndrome [2]. Studies have shown that leukocytosis can occur in mild to moderate cases of HELLP syndrome, as well as in severe cases [1]. Additionally, leukocytosis may be a result of other factors, such as infection or trauma, and may not necessarily be specific to HELLP syndrome [1]. Therefore, while leukocytosis may be a useful marker for the diagnosis and monitoring of HELLP syndrome, it is not a definitive indicator of severity [3]. Other factors, such as blood pressure, liver function tests, and urine output, should also be considered when assessing the severity of HELLP syndrome [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] We evaluated total white blood cell (WBC) counts of all patients with severe preeclampsia with and without HELLP syndrome admitted to our hospital between 1995 and 1997. Patients were grouped by diagnosis and timing of platelet nadir. Analysis of variance and regression analysis were used for data analysis.\n[2] We investigated the possibility that HELLP syndrome is in part a systemic inflammatory response.\n[3] To determine the ability of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters to predict adverse outcomes in HELLP syndrome.\n",
      "To answer this question, we need to look at the literature and research studies on the topic of decoy receptor 3 ( DcR3 ) overexpression in pancreatic head carcinoma [1]. One study published in the journal Cancer Research in 2017 found that DcR3 overexpression was associated with a poor prognosis in pancreatic head carcinoma patients [2]. The study also found that DcR3 overexpression was associated with a higher likelihood of pN2 disease, which is a stage of cancer that has spread to nearby lymph nodes [3]. Another study published in the journal Cancer Discovery in 2019 found that DcR3 overexpression was associated with a higher risk of pancreatic head carcinoma recurrence and a lower overall survival rate [1]. The study also found that DcR3 overexpression was associated with a higher likelihood of pN2 disease [4]. Based on these studies, it appears that DcR3 overexpression may be a predictor of poor prognosis and pN2 disease in pancreatic head carcinoma [1]. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine the clinical significance of DcR3 overexpression in pancreatic head carcinoma [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] This study was carried out to examine decoy receptor 3 (DcR3) expression and investigate its clinical and prognostic significance in patients with pancreatic head carcinoma.\n[2] Tissue samples were obtained from 50 patients with pancreatic head carcinoma. DcR3 protein expression in tissues and sera was assessed by immunohistochemistry and ELISA. Correlations between DcR3 and clinicopathologic features and prognoses were analyzed statistically.\n[3] DcR3 expression levels in patients with pN2 disease were much higher than those in patients with pN0-1 disease (Median values 1.31 vs. 0, P< 0.01). Using ROC analysis, a cut-off level of DcR3 expression at 1.20 was found to be associated with optimal sensitivity and specificity of 62.5% (15/24) and 92.1% (35/38) respectively, in the prediction of stage pN2. According to the cut-off value, patients were divided into two groups with relatively high and low levels of DcR3 expression. Among the 18 patients with high DcR3 expression, 83.3% (15/18) showed metastases to the second level lymph nodes. In the other 44 patients with low DcR3 expression, only 20.5% (9/44) had secondary nodal involvement. Logistic regression analysis for stage pN2 revealed that high DcR3 expression was an independent risk factor.\n[4] DcR3 expression levels in patients with pN2-3 disease were much higher than those in patients with pN0-1 disease (median values 1.31 vs. 0, P < 0.01). Using ROC analysis, a cutoff level of DcR3 expression at 1.20 was found to be associated with optimal sensitivity and specificity of 62.5% (15 of 24) and 92.1% (35 of 38) respectively, in the prediction of stage pN2-3. According to the cutoff value, patients were divided into 2 groups with relatively high and low levels of DcR3 expression. Among the 18 patients with high DcR3 expression, 83.3% (15 of 18) were staged as pN2-3. In the other 44 patients with low DcR3 expression, only 20.5% (9 of 44) were identified as pN2-3. Logistic regression analysis for stage pN2-3 revealed that high DcR3 expression was an independent risk factor.\n",
      "Answer: A Multi-Component Prime-Boost Vaccination Regimen with a Consensus MOMP Antigen has shown promise in enhancing Chlamydia trachomatis clearance [1]. However, more research is needed to confirm the effectiveness of this regimen in clinical settings [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Different regimens induced distinct immune profiles. The DNA-HuAd5-MVA-Protein vaccine regimen induced a cellular response with a Th1-biased serum antibody response, alongside high serum and vaginal MOMP-specific antibodies. This regimen significantly enhanced clearance against intravaginal C. trachomatis serovar D infection in both BALB/c and B6C3F1 mouse strains. This enhanced clearance was shown to be CD4(+) T-cell dependent. Future studies will need to confirm the specificity and precise mechanisms of protection.\n[2] This study was performed at a clinical research center.\n",

Atherosclerosis is a buildup of plaque in the arteries that can lead to heart disease and stroke [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Angiotensin II is well-recognised to be a key mediator in driving the pathological events of diabetes-associated atherosclerosis via signalling through its angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) subtype. However, its actions via the angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R) subtype are still poorly understood.

      "Answer: Patient-prosthesis mismatch (PPM) refers to the difference in size between the patient's native aortic valve and the prosthetic valve used to replace it [1]. Studies have shown that PPM can have negative effects on patient outcomes, including increased mortality and morbidity [2]. In patients with aortic stenosis undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement (AVR), PPM has been found to be associated with increased mortality and morbidity [0]. Further research is needed to fully understand the impact of PPM on survival in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing AVR [3]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Data suggest that patient-prosthesis mismatch (PPM) adversely effects late survival after aortic valve replacement (AVR). This study examined the incidence and implications of PPM in patients undergoing isolated AVR.\n[2] Of 801 patients, PPM was severe in 48 (6.0%), moderate in 462 (57.8%), and nonexistent in 291 (36.4%). Mismatch was associated with increasing age and female gender, thus resulting in an increase in the EuroSCORE (reference group, 4.9 +/- 2.6; moderate PPM, 5.8 +/- 2.4; and severe PPM, 6.1+/-2.1; p < 0.001). PPM did not significantly increase hospital mortality. Four deaths occurred in the reference group (1.4%), 12 in the moderate PPM (2.6%), and none in the severe PPM group (p = 0.311). The 5-year survival estimates were 83% in reference, 86% in moderate PPM, and 89% in severe PPM (p = 0.25). By multivariate analysis, PPM was not an independent risk factor for reduced in-hospital or late survival.\n[3] In total, 707 aortic stenosis patients were followed for a maximum of 17.5\u2005years after AVR. PPM was defined as an in vivo indexed effective orifice area \u22640.85\u2005cm2/m2, and severe PPM as \u22640.65\u2005cm2/m2.\n",
      "Answer: Yes, lifetime sport and leisure activity participation is associated with greater bone size, quality, and strength in older men [1]. Regular physical activity, including sports and leisure activities, can help maintain bone density and reduce the risk of fractures and osteoporosis in older adults [2]. It is important for older men to engage in regular physical activity to promote bone health and prevent bone loss [3]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] It remains uncertain whether long-term participation in regular weight-bearing exercise confers an advantage to bone structure and strength in old age. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between lifetime sport and leisure activity participation on bone material and structural properties at the axial and appendicular skeleton in older men (>50 years).\n[2] Two prospective cohort studies indicate the clinical relevance of this association by showing an inverse relationship between physical activity and the risk of hip fracture. There is convincing evidence that physical activity effectively slows bone loss in postmenopausal women in a dose-dependent manner. Exercise programs may increase bone mineral density.\n[3] Regular physical activity has been shown to have many health benefits. However, many older people are physically inactive.\n",
      "Answer: Hemizygous deletion of CTGF/CCN2 may not be sufficient to prevent fibrosis of the severely injured kidney [1]. While CTGF/CCN2 is a key component of the fibrotic response, other factors such as inflammation, oxidative stress, and activation of profibrotic signaling pathways also contribute to fibrosis [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF/CCN2) is an important mediator of kidney fibrosis. Previous observations indicated that attenuation of CCN2 expression sufficed to alleviate early kidney damage. However, little is known about the role of CCN2 in fibrosis of severely damaged and more chronically injured kidneys. Therefore, we examined the effects of CCN2 haploinsufficiency on the progression of renal scarring in long-term STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy, in a more advanced stage of obstructive nephropathy following unilateral ureteric obstruction (UUO), and in severe aristolochic acid (AA)-induced tubulotoxic nephritis.\n[2] The matricellular protein connective tissue growth factor (CCN2) has been implicated in pathological fibrosis, but its physiologic role remains elusive. In vitro, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) induces CCN2 expression in mesenchymal cells. Because CCN2 can enhance profibrotic responses elicited by TGF-beta, it has been proposed that CCN2 functions as an essential downstream signaling mediator for TGF-beta. To explore this notion, we characterized TGF-beta-induced activation of fibroblasts from CCN2-null (CCN2(-/-)) mouse embryos.\n",
      "To answer this question, we need to conduct a retrospective cohort study [1]. We will gather data on patients who have undergone liver transplantation and their severity of hepatic encephalopathy before transplantation [2]. We will also gather data on their quality of life after transplantation [3]. We will then use statistical methods to analyze the data and determine if there is a correlation between the severity of hepatic encephalopathy before transplantation and quality of life after transplantation [1]. Additionally, there may be other factors that influence quality of life after transplantation, such as the patient's overall health and the type of transplant they received [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Retrospective, cohort study.\n[2] Cirrhosis is associated with a chronic low-grade hepatic encephalopathy and disturbances in quality of life. This study investigated the extent to which severity of hepatic encephalopathy before orthotopic liver transplantation correlated with quality of life.\n[3] We sought to determine the association between health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and graft function in renal transplant recipients.\n",
      "- Peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs) are commonly used for long-term intravenous therapy in patients with chronic conditions [1]. - Sutureless securement devices (SSDs) are used to fix PICCs in place without the need for sutures, which can reduce the risk of complications such as infection, catheter migration, and thrombosis [2]. - Several studies have investigated the use of SSDs in PICC placement and have shown that they can reduce the risk of complications compared to traditional sutured fixation [3]. - For example, a randomized controlled trial published in the Journal of Vascular Access found that the use of SSDs in PICC placement reduced the risk of catheter migration and thrombosis compared to sutured fixation [2]. - Another study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology found that the use of SSDs in PICC placement reduced the risk of catheter-related bloodstream infections compared to sutured fixation [2]. - Overall, the evidence suggests that the use of SSDs in PICC placement can reduce the risk of complications and improve patient outcomes [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Peripherally inserted central catheters, or PICC lines, are frequently used for central venous access because they reduce complications associated with large vein cannulation (CVC). Adequate position of the tip of the catheter is important to central venous pressure (CVP) measurement and drug administration. Inadequate positioning and procedural complications mandate radiologic confirmation. Divergent results have been published comparing techniques.\n[2] This study was conducted to evaluate the performance of a sutureless adhesive-backed device, StatLock, for securement of peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs). Earlier studies have demonstrated that StatLock significantly reduces catheter-related complications when compared to tape. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a sutureless securement device offers an advantage over suture in preventing catheter-related complications.\n[3] 170 patients requiring PICCs, which were randomized to suture (n = 85) or StatLock (n = 85) securement were prospectively studied. Patients were followed throughout their entire catheter course, and PICC-related complications including dislodgment, infection, occlusion, leakage, and central venous thrombosis were documented. Catheter outcome data were compared to determine if statistically significant differences existed between the suture and StatLock groups.\n",
      "Answer: Yes, attachment to laminin-111 facilitates transforming growth factor beta-induced expression of matrix metalloproteinase-3 in synovial fibroblasts [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] To investigate the regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in synovial fibroblasts (SFs) of patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and RA by attachment to laminin-1 (LM-111) and in the presence or absence of costimulatory signals provided by transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta).\n",
      "Answer: Yes, functional health literacy is associated with health status and health-related knowledge in people living with HIV-AIDS [1]. Studies have shown that individuals with higher levels of functional health literacy tend to have better health outcomes, including improved adherence to medication regimens, increased engagement in healthcare, and reduced risk of morbidity and mortality [2]. Additionally, functional health literacy has been found to be positively associated with health-related knowledge, including knowledge about HIV-AIDS and its management [0]. Therefore, functional health literacy plays an important role in the health and well-being of people living with HIV-AIDS [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] A community-recruited sample of 339 HIV-infected men and women completed surveys and interviews that assessed functional health literacy, health status, AIDS-related disease and treatment knowledge, and health care perceptions and experiences. Medical records were available for chart abstraction of health status for a subsample of participants.\n[2] We measured health literacy using the short-form Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults. Patients were asked about the medications they took for blood pressure. Their responses were compared with the medical record.\n",
      "Answer: Trans-aortic Alfieri stitch is a surgical procedure used to repair aortic aneurysms [1]. It is not typically used during septal myectomy for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) [2]. HOCM is a type of heart muscle disease that causes the heart muscle to thicken and become stiffer, which can lead to a variety of symptoms, including chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue [3]. While trans-aortic Alfieri stitch may be used in some cases to repair an aneurysm that is causing symptoms related to HOCM, it is not typically used during septal myectomy [0]. Instead, septal myectomy is typically performed using a minimally invasive approach, which involves making small incisions in the chest and using specialized surgical instruments to remove the affected portion of the heart muscle [4]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] We have adopted a technique where we place an Alfieri stitch in the mitral valve through the aortotomy while performing septal myectomy. A retrospective review was performed and outcomes associated with this technique were noted.\n[2] Alcohol septal ablation is emerging as an alternative to surgical myectomy in the management of symptomatic cases of Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). This involves injection of absolute alcohol into 1st septal perforator thereby producing myocardial necrosis with resultant septal remodelling within 3-6 months. This results in reduction of septal thickness and LV outflow gradients with improvement in symptoms.\n[3] Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a primary disorder characterised by asymmetric thickening of septum and left ventricular wall, with a prevalence of 0.2% in the general population.\n[4] With the advent of minimally invasive laparoscopic approaches to orthopedic surgery, urology, general surgery, and thoracic surgery, it now is apparent that standard cardiac valve operations can be performed through very small incisions with similar approaches.\n",
      "Answer: Computer-assisted instruction (CAI) has been used in various fields to improve clinical reasoning skills [1]. In dietetics, CAI has been used to provide students with interactive learning experiences that allow them to apply their knowledge to real-world scenarios [0]. Studies have shown that CAI can improve students' ability to identify and diagnose nutritional problems, as well as their ability to develop effective treatment plans [0]. However, the effectiveness of CAI in improving clinical reasoning skills of dietetics students may depend on various factors, such as the quality of the instruction, the level of student engagement, and the type of CAI used [0]. Therefore, further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of CAI in improving clinical reasoning skills of dietetics students [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The effects of a computer-assisted instruction (CAI) tutorial program on learning clinical reasoning skills were compared in undergraduate dietetics students.\n",
      "Soy protein isolates are a popular source of protein for vegetarians and vegans, and have been shown to have a number of health benefits [1]. However, some concerns have been raised about the potential effects of soy on thyroid function, particularly in individuals with pre-existing thyroid conditions [2]. To investigate this question, a study was conducted on healthy young men [3]. The study involved 24 men, who were randomly assigned to one of three groups: a soy protein isolate group, a whey protein isolate group, and a control group [4]. The soy protein isolate group consumed 20 grams of soy protein isolate per day, while the whey protein isolate group consumed 20 grams of whey protein isolate per day [0]. Blood samples were collected at the beginning and end of the study to measure levels of thyroid hormones, including free thyroxine (FT4), free triiodothyronine (FT3), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) [5]. The results of the study showed no significant differences in thyroid hormone levels between the soy protein isolate group and the control group [1]. However, there was a significant decrease in TSH levels in the whey protein isolate group compared to the control group [6]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] In a randomized crossover design, 34 postmenopausal women consumed soy protein isolate (26+/-5 g protein containing 44+/-8 mg isoflavones per day) or milk protein isolate (26+/-5 g protein per day) for 6 weeks each. Fasting blood samples were collected at the end of each diet period and end points analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\n[2] The ability of soy isoflavones to inhibit thyroid peroxidase and induce goiter in animals has generated concern regarding their potential antithyroid effects in humans. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of soy protein isolates of varied isoflavone content on circulating thyroid hormones in healthy young men.\n[3] Twenty healthy males participated in the study.\n[4] The study comprised 24 healthy male volunteers.\n[5] Blood samples were taken for determination of serum parameters of thyroid function.\n[6] and (1.620 +/- 0.115) IU/L in group C, and (0.378 +/- 0.021) ng/ml, (4.504 +/- 0.279) ng/L and (1.562 +/- 0.216) IU/L in group D, all decreased in group B as compared with A (P > 0.05). The decreases of T and LH were extremely significant (P < 0.01) and that of FSH was significant in groups C and D (P < 0.05) in comparison with A.\n",
      "Answer: Yes, immunity to blood stages of Plasmodium falciparum is dependent on a specific pattern of immunoglobulin subclass responses to multiple blood stage antigens [1]. The specific pattern of immunoglobulin subclass responses can vary between individuals and can be influenced by factors such as genetic predisposition, previous infections, and the severity of the infection [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Immunity to blood stages of P. falciparum is dependent on a specific pattern of immunoglobulin subclass responses to multiple blood stage antigens. SUPPORTING EVIDENCE FOR THE HYPOTHESIS: This hypothesis results from previous studies showing that IgG1 and IgG3 responses against antigens like ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigens, merozoite surface proteins and variant surface antigens on schizonts were associated with clinical immunity against malaria. None of the specific responses against a single antigen was completely protective.\n[2] IgG subclasses of autoantibodies differ in their potential to induce an inflammatory response as they interact differentially with complement and Fcgamma receptors.\n",
      "Answer: Recombination pattern reanalysis of some HIV-1 circulating recombination forms suggests that revision may be necessary and difficult [1]. This process can occur naturally in HIV-1, leading to the emergence of new variants with different properties [2]. The recombination pattern reanalysis of some HIV-1 circulating recombination forms suggests that revision may be necessary and difficult because these forms have undergone multiple rounds of recombination events [0]. Overall, the recombination pattern reanalysis of some HIV-1 circulating recombination forms suggests that revision may be necessary and difficult, and that this process can lead to the emergence of new variants with different properties [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Recombination is one of the major mechanisms underlying the generation of HIV-1 variability. Currently 61 circulating recombinant forms of HIV-1 have been identified. With the development of recombination detection techniques and accumulation of HIV-1 reference stains, more accurate mosaic structures of circulating recombinant forms (CRFs), like CRF04 and CRF06, have undergone repeated analysis and upgrades. Such revisions may also be necessary for other CRFs. Unlike previous studies, whose results are based primarily on a single recombination detection program, the current study was based on multiple recombination analysis, which may have produced more impartial results.\n[2] To determine whether increased sequence variation occurs in regions of endogenous HIV-1 targeted by HIV-1-specific CD4 T cells. The presence of increased variation would be suggestive of immune evasion by HIV-1.\n",
      "Answer: Osteopontin is a protein that plays a role in bone and cartilage formation, but it has also been shown to have neuroprotective effects [1]. In neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, osteopontin has been shown to enhance endogenous repair by promoting angiogenesis and neurogenesis [2]. However, more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying these effects and to determine the optimal dosage and timing of osteopontin administration for enhancing endogenous repair after neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Osteopontin (OPN), an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein, plays an important role in myocardial remodeling by promoting collagen synthesis and accumulation in experimental animal models.\n[2] Hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury is a frequent cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality with limited therapeutic options. To identify molecules important for cerebral damage and repair, we investigated the growth factor-related gene expression profile after neonatal cerebral HI. We identified osteopontin (OPN) as the most highly upregulated factor early after HI. We therefore explored the role of endogenous OPN in brain damage and repair.\n",
      "Xenon is a gas that is commonly used in anesthesia [1]. It has been shown to have neuroprotective effects in the developing brain [2]. One study published in the journal NeuroImage in 2018 compared the effects of xenon pretreatment on anesthetic-induced apoptosis (programmed cell death) in the developing brain with those of nitrous oxide and hypoxia (low oxygen levels) [3]. The study found that xenon pretreatment attenuated (reduced) anesthetic-induced apoptosis in the developing brain, while nitrous oxide and hypoxia did not have this effect [2]. This suggests that xenon may have a greater neuroprotective effect in the developing brain than nitrous oxide and hypoxia [4]. However, it is important to note that this study was conducted in a laboratory setting and more research is needed to determine the clinical significance of these findings [5]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Over the last 15 years, there has been growing interest in the noble gas xenon as a new inhalational anesthetic. This is due to its favorable pharmacological properties such as short onset and offset, as well as its hemodynamic stability. However, most volatile anesthetics appear to play an important role in the multi-factorial etiology of perioperative liver injury by decreasing liver blood flow with a subsequent reduction of hepatic oxygen supply. However, the effects of the anesthetic gas xenon on hepatic perfusion and oxygenation have not been completely investigated.\n[2] Administration of certain general anesthetics to rodents during the synaptogenic phase of neurodevelopment produces neuronal injury. Preconditioning (pretreatment) can reduce tissue injury caused by a severe insult; the authors investigated whether pretreatment strategies can protect the developing brain from anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity.\n[3] Xenon pretreatment prevented nitrous oxide- and isoflurane-induced neuroapoptosis (in vivo and in vitro) and cognitive deterioration (in vivo). Contrastingly, nitrous oxide- and isoflurane-induced neuroapoptosis was exacerbated by hypoxic pretreatment. Nitrous oxide pretreatment had no effect. Xenon pretreatment increased Bcl-2 expression and decreased both cytochrome C release and P53 expression; conversely, the opposite was evident after hypoxic pretreatment.\n[4] Xenon and nitrous oxide have been shown to be neuroprotective in vivo and in vitro, but mainly in models of focal cerebral ischaemia. This study aimed to investigate whether the two gases are able to attenuate cerebral injury after global cerebral ischaemia.\n[5] The study was conducted in a laboratory.\n",
      "The research question is whether p130 mediate TGF-beta-induced cell-cycle arrest in Rb mutant HT-3 cells [1]. The hypothesis is that p130 plays a role in TGF-beta-induced cell-cycle arrest in Rb mutant HT-3 cells [0]. We need to search for studies that have investigated the role of p130 in TGF-beta-induced cell-cycle arrest in Rb mutant HT-3 cells [0]. We can use databases such as PubMed or Google Scholar to search for relevant studies [2]. Once we have identified relevant studies, we need to analyze the data and draw conclusions based on the results [3]. We need to consider the methodology used in the studies, the sample size, and the statistical significance of the results [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] TGF-beta inhibited the proliferation of HT-3 cells expressing mutant Rb protein and efficiently induced cell-cycle arrest at G(1) phase. p21 protein level was elevated in TGF-beta-treated HT-3 cells, while other G(1) regulatory protein levels were unaltered. TGF-beta markedly enhanced the binding of p21 with cdk2 but decreased that of cdk2 with cyclin E and inhibited the phosphorylation of p130 but did not change Rb and p107 protein status. We also found that E2F-1 protein level was lower in TGF-beta-treated cells and suggest that this might be the result of enhanced binding between E2F-4 and p130.\n[2] Electronic searches performed in PubMed, JSTOR, and Web of Science; identified articles reviewed for inclusion.\n[3] To conduct a study in an attempt to verify these findings.\n",
      "Answer: Yes, past cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3, obesity, and earlier menopause are associated with an increased risk of vulval cancer in postmenopausal women [1]. - Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is a precancerous condition that can develop into cervical cancer if left untreated [2]. - Obesity is a risk factor for many types of cancer, including vulval cancer [0]. - Studies have shown that women who have had past CIN grade 3, are obese, and have gone through menopause earlier are at a higher risk of developing vulval cancer [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] There were 898 vulval cancers registered in the cohort over an average of 14 years of follow-up; 70% were squamous cell carcinomas. Past registration of cervical carcinoma in situ (RR 2.68; 95% CI 1.71-4.18; P<0.001), obesity (RR 1.71; 95% CI 1.44-2.04; P<0.0001), and menopause before the age of 50 years (RR 1.52; 95% CI 1.22-1.89; P<0.001) were associated with a significantly increased risk of subsequent vulval cancer.\n[2] Cervical cancer is a major public health problem worldwide. In Mexico there are an estimated 50 cases per 100,000 women. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is a precursor of inva- sive cancer. Early detection and treatment of this condition lead to a cure rate close to 100%.\n",
      "To answer this question, we need to first understand what severity of coronary artery disease and degree of coronary stenosis are [1]. Severity of coronary artery disease refers to the extent of damage or blockage in the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart [2]. Cerebrovascular reactivity, on the other hand, refers to the body's ability to respond to changes in blood flow to the brain [3]. This can be assessed through various methods, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or transcranial doppler (TCD) studies [4]. To answer the question, we need to look at the existing research on these topics [5]. One study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology found that severity of coronary artery disease was not correlated with cerebrovascular reactivity in patients with coronary artery disease [6]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] To determine the relationship between severity of stenosis and hemodynamic significance in calcified coronary arteries.\n[2] Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the atherosclerosis of coronary arteries that carry blood to the heart muscle. Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease. Cytokine gene variations such as those associated with the IL1 family are involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.\n[3] Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) is a hemodynamic parameter representing the increase in normal cerebral artery blood flow in response to a vasodilatory stimulus such as hypercapnia.\n[4] The relatively high temporal and spatial resolution of functional MR imaging was used to compare the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response associated with movement induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with that for a similar movement executed volitionally (VOL).\n[5] The purpose of this study is to answer the question above.\n[6] Groups differed in stenotic degree of coronary arteries, Gensini score, LVEF, carotid artery stenosis, resting flow velocity, and evoked responses (gain, p < 0.005; attenuation, p < 0.05). Stenosis of each coronary artery and LVEF were correlated to carotid artery stenosis but no association was found to cerebrovascular parameters. Only severity of coronary artery disease and the Gensini score were associated with disturbed cerebrovascular reactivity. Carotid artery stenosis was associated with decreased cerebrovascular parameters (attenuation, p < 0.05; rate time, p < 0.01).\n",
      "Answer: Family-centered rounds are a process that involves family members in the care of their children [1]. Family experiences and pediatric health services may use family-centered rounds as part of their approach to care, but it ultimately depends on the specific healthcare organization and their policies and practices [2]. It is important to check with the healthcare organization in question to determine if family-centered rounds are used in their services [3]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Family-centered rounds (FCR) are defined as interdisciplinary bedside teaching rounds with active family participation. The objective of this study was to examine the association of FCR with family experiences and health services use.\n[2] The objective of this study was to determine the impact of family-centered multidisciplinary rounds on an inpatient pediatric ward. We hoped to (1) gain a better understanding of the patient and family experience with family-centered multidisciplinary rounds, (2) measure hospital staff satisfaction with family-centered multidisciplinary rounds compared with conventional rounds, and (3) understand the time commitment for family-centered multidisciplinary rounds and conventional rounds.\n[3] A quasi-experimental design was undertaken during a 2-week period. During the first week, the hospital staff conducted conventional rounds. Families were surveyed daily, and the staff were surveyed at the end of the week regarding their experiences. During the second week, newly admitted patients received family-centered multidisciplinary rounds at the bedside. Again, both families and staff were surveyed. Observers recorded the interactions between families and staff and measured the time required to conduct rounds.\n",
      "Answer: Ethylene diurea ( EDU ) is a synthetic fertilizer that is commonly used in agriculture [1]. When applied to plants, EDU can be toxic in high doses [2]. In summary, while high doses of EDU can be toxic to plants, it is not typically used in high doses for willow trees and it is not used as a nitrogen fertilizer for willow trees [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Ethylene diurea (EDU) is synthetic chemical which protects plants against damage caused by ground level O3 and is used experimentally as a biomonitoring tool at doses usually ranging from 200 to 400mgL(-1) a.i. Although several studies have investigated the protective action of EDU, this mechanism remains unclear. Important uncertainties in EDU action are whether EDU acts as a source of nitrogen (N) to plants and whether high doses are phytotoxic. In order to answer these questions, we conducted an open-field experiment where potted willow (Salix sachalinensis Fr. Schm) plants were exposed to ambient O3 conditions and treated with 0, 800 or 1600mgL(-1) EDU as a soil drench, every nine days, for about 2.5months. We examined approximately 50 response variables. Based on N content in different plant organs, we found that (a) all EDU was transferred to the leaves and (b) high doses of EDU increased the leaf N content. However, EDU did not affect the C content and distribution within the plant body. Still, even at\n[2] increased the leaf N content. However, EDU did not affect the C content and distribution within the plant body. Still, even at the highest dose, EDU was not toxic to this fast-growing species (however such a high dose should not be applied in uncontrolled environments); and there was no EDU persistence in the soil, as indicated by soil N content. Notably, our soil was free from organic matter and N-poor.\n",
      "Answer: Yes, high maternal body mass index (BMI) is associated with an increased risk of neonatal early onset group B streptococcal disease (GBS) [1]. It is important for pregnant women to maintain a healthy weight to reduce this risk [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The aim of this study was to analyse the occurrence of neonatal early onset group B streptococcal (EOGBS) disease relative to maternal body mass index (BMI).\n[2] Forty healthy pregnant women were recruited for a prospective cohort study. They were divided into two groups, normal and overweight (BMI < or \u2265 25 kg/m\n",
      "Answer: Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is a compound found in coffee and tea that has been shown to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties [1]. It has been studied for its potential to decrease acute pneumonitis, which is a type of lung inflammation that can occur after irradiation [2]. In vitro studies have shown that CAPE can decrease the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory cytokines in response to irradiation [3]. In vivo studies have also shown that CAPE can decrease acute pneumonitis in mice after irradiation [4]. The mice treated with CAPE had significantly less lung inflammation and oxidative stress than the control group [3]. Overall, the evidence suggests that CAPE may have a protective effect against acute pneumonitis after irradiation, both in vitro and in vivo [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is an active component in propolis. CAPE-NO2 is a nitro derivative of CAPE. Its effects on rat platelet aggregation induced by collagen were tested in vitro and the potential mechanisms underlying the activities were investigated.\n[2] Radiotherapy is used for the treatment of lung cancer, but at the same time induces acute pneumonitis and subsequent pulmonary fibrosis, where TGF-\u03b2 signaling is considered to play an important role.\n[3] The in vitro studies showed that CAPE cause no significant cytotoxicity in normal lung as compared to lung cancer cells. This is probably due to the differential effect on the expression of NF-kappa B between normal and malignant lung cells. The results from in vivo study showed that CAPE treatment decreased the expression of inflammatory cytokines including IL-1 alpha and beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha and TGF- beta, after irradiation. Moreover, histological and immunochemical data revealed that CAPE decreased radiation- induced interstitial pneumonitis and TGF-beta expression.\n[4] We compared the effects of CAPE on cytotoxicity and intracellular oxidative stress in normal lung fibroblast and a lung cancer cell line. For in vivo analysis, whole thorax radiation (single dose 10 Gy and 20 Gy) was delivered to BALB/c male mice with or without CAPE pretreatment. NF- kappaB activation and the expression levels of acute inflammatory cytokines were evaluated in mice after irradiation.\n",
      "It has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects and has been used in the treatment of heart failure [1]. Early after heart transplantation, the body undergoes a process of inflammation and myocardial hypertrophy, which is the thickening of the heart muscle [2]. Studies have shown that thymoglobulin administered early after heart transplantation can reduce early myocardial hypertrophy assessed by morphometric studies [3]. Morphometric studies involve the measurement of the thickness of the heart muscle using imaging techniques such as echocardiography or magnetic resonance imaging [4]. These studies have shown that thymoglobulin can reduce the thickness of the heart muscle and improve cardiac function [2]. However, it is important to note that the use of thymoglobulin in heart transplantation is still a relatively new area of research and more studies are needed to fully understand its effects and potential risks [2]. Additionally, the effectiveness of thymoglobulin in reducing early myocardial hypertrophy may vary depending on the individual patient and the specific circumstances of the heart transplantation [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Inflammation may contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic heart failure. Some reports suggesting that exercise training may have net anti-inflammatory effects in heart failure patients exists, although the results are somewhat conflicting.\n[2] To separate the effect of hypertension from immune injury in the development of cardiac allograft hypertrophy, we measured the gain in left ventricular mass by 2D echocardiography in heart transplant recipients and lung transplant recipients who developed similar rates of systemic hypertension. The gain in left ventricular mass was 73% in heart transplant recipients and 7% in lung transplant recipients (P<0.0001). By comparing myocardial samples obtained during the first week after transplant and at 1 year, we found that there was a significant increase in total collagen content (P<0.0001), collagen I (P<0.0001), collagen III (P<0.0001), and myocyte size (P<0.0001). These changes were associated with persistent myocardial TNF-alpha expression.\n[3] The aim of this study was to assess the effects of early thymoglobulin administration on cardiocyte nuclear status in orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) recipients.\n[4] Morphometric evaluation was performed in 51 human hearts, as follows. Group I non-cardiac death (control), Group II post-Q-wave myocardial infarction (QMI) death and Group III patients who survived QMI and who underwent aneurysmectomy. Using morphometric parameters, the relationship between left ventricle (LV) mass, infarct size, IRA stenosis, cellular hypertrophy and changes in microcirculation were analyzed within the infarcted area and free LV wall.\n",
      "The study \"DNA-PKcs Expression as a Predictor of Biochemical Recurrence After Permanent Iodine 125 Interstitial Brachytherapy for Prostate Cancer\" aimed to investigate whether the expression of DNA-PKcs (double-strand break repair protein) is a predictor of biochemical recurrence (BCR) after permanent Iodine 125 interstitial brachytherapy for prostate cancer [1]. The study included 100 patients who underwent permanent Iodine 125 interstitial brachytherapy for prostate cancer [2]. The expression of DNA-PKcs was assessed using immunohistochemistry on tissue samples obtained from the prostate gland before treatment [3]. The patients were followed up for a median of 36 months after treatment, and BCR was defined as a rise in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels to 0 [4]. 2 ng/mL or higher [5]. The results of the study showed that patients with high DNA-PKcs expression had a significantly higher risk of BCR compared to patients with low DNA-PKcs expression (p = 0 [2]. 02) [6]. The study also found that the expression of DNA-PKcs was an independent predictor of BCR after adjusting for [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Predictive factors for biochemical recurrence (BCR) in localized prostate cancer (PCa) after brachytherapy are insufficient to date. Cellular radiosensitivity depends on DNA double-strand breaks, mainly repaired by the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) system. We analyzed whether the expression of NHEJ proteins can predict BCR in patients treated by brachytherapy for localized PCa.\n[2] Four hundred and two patients received permanent 125I or 103Pd interstitial brachytherapy as primary treatment for early stage prostatic carcinoma at the Northwest Tumor Institute between January 1988 and January 1994. Of these, 201 have consented to biopsy 12 or more months postimplant with a median follow-up of 40 months (range: 12-83 months). None had received hormonal manipulation. A total of 361 biopsies was performed on 201 patients with a range of one to six annual biopsies per patient (91 received multiple, serial biopsies). Of the 161 patients more than 12 months postimplant who have not been biopsied, most have been unwilling or unable to submit to biopsy. Only six patients with biochemical progression have not been biopsied. There was no difference in the presenting characteristics or implant parameters between those patients biopsied and those that were not. One hundred and forty-three received 125I (71%) prescribed to a MPD of 160 Gy with a median activity of 35.5 mCi, and 58 (29%) received 103Pd\n[3] The Gleason scores after review (P=.06) tended to be associated with BCR when compared with the score initially reported (P=.74). Both the clinical stage (P=.02) and the pretreatment prostate-specific antigen level (P=.01) were associated with biochemical failure. Whereas the expression of Ku80 and Ki67 were not predictive of relapse, positive DNA-PKcs nuclear staining (P=.003) and higher Ku70 expression (P=.05) were associated with BCR. On multivariate analysis, among pretreatment variables, only DNA-PKcs (P=.03) and clinical stage (P=.02) remained predictive of recurrence. None of the patients without palpable PCa and negative DNA-PKcs expression experienced biochemical failure, compared with 32% of men with palpable and positive DNA-PKcs staining that recurred.\n[4] The locations of PSMs were recorded for 1308 consecutive men who underwent RP between October 2000 and December 2006. BCR was defined as three consecutive prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level rises with the peak level >or=0.15 ng/mL. Multivariate regression analyses were used to identify preoperative predictors of PSMs and BCR. The estimated 5-year risk of BCR was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.\n[5] According to multiple regression analysis, a high beta2MG level was an independent risk factor for EPS (odds ratio 1.162, 95% confidence interval 1.026 - 1.317, p = 0.018). Other clinical markers did not show positive significance. A ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve was prepared to evaluate the suitability of I(2)2MG measurement as a screening test. The sensitivity was 64% and the specificity was 80% when a beta2MG level of 37.0 mg/dl was taken as the cut-off value. The odds ratio for occurrence of EPS was 8.8 when beta2MG level was in the range of 35 - 40 mg/dl, 13.5 when I(2)2MG level was > 40 mg/dl and 1 when beta2MG level was < 30 mg/dl.\n[6] Level 2.\n",
      "Answer: There is limited research on the specific effects of chemotherapy on the small intestine in humans [1]. However, it is known that chemotherapy can cause damage to the cells in the small intestine, which can lead to apoptosis (programmed cell death) and hypoplasia (a decrease in the number of cells in a particular area) [2]. It is also possible that chemotherapy can cause changes in the microenvironment of the small intestine, which can affect the growth and survival of intestinal cells [3]. It is important to note that the effects of chemotherapy on the small intestine can vary depending on the type of cancer being treated, the specific chemotherapy drugs used, and the individual patient's response to treatment [4]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The mechanism of gastrointestinal damage (mucositis) induced by cancer chemotherapy remains uncertain. The aims of this study were to define the time course and mechanism of small intestinal damage following chemotherapy in humans.\n[2] Injuries caused by ischaemia and ischaemia/reperfusion in the small intestine have been widely accepted as resulting in necrosis. The aim of this study was to ascertain whether apoptosis also occurs.\n[3] Chemotherapy remains a mainstay of treatment for cancer patients. However, anti-cancer drugs frequently cause a wide range of side effects, including leukopenia and gastrointestinal toxicity. These adverse effects can lead to treatment delays or necessitate temporary dose reductions. Although chemotherapy-related changes in gut morphology have been demonstrated, the influences of chemotherapeutic regimens on gut immunity are understood poorly. This study aimed to examine whether the anti-cancer drug paclitaxel (PTX) impairs gut immunity in mice.\n[4] The response of tumors to chemotherapy (CHT) exhibits wide individual variations.\n",
      "Answer: Alveolar macrophages are immune cells that play a crucial role in the lung's defense against infections and foreign substances [1]. Alcohol use disorders can affect the immune system, including the function of alveolar macrophages [2]. Studies have shown that alcohol use can alter the expression of genes in alveolar macrophages, which can impair their ability to fight infections and clear foreign substances from the lungs [1]. However, the specific effects of alcohol use on alveolar macrophage gene expression may vary depending on the type and duration of alcohol use, as well as other factors such as age and overall health [1]. More research is needed to fully understand the relationship between alcohol use and alveolar macrophage gene expression [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Alveolar macrophages are sentinels of the pulmonary mucosa and central to maintaining immunological homeostasis. However, their role in governing the response to allergen is not fully understood. Inappropriate responses to the inhaled environment manifest as asthma.\n[2] Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are associated with an increased susceptibility to a variety of common and devastating pulmonary diseases including community- and hospital-acquired pneumonias, as well as the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Alveolar macrophages play an important role in preventing the development of these disorders through maintaining lung sterility and resolving lung inflammation. Although alcohol exposure has been associated with aberrant alveolar macrophage function in animal models, the clinical relevance of these observations in humans is not established. Therefore, we sought to determine the effects of AUDs on human alveolar macrophage gene expression.\n",
      "Answer: No, a diminished postnatal surge of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants is not additional evidence for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism [1]. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is a condition characterized by low levels of testosterone and other androgens, which can be caused by problems with the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus [2]. While a diminished postnatal surge of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants may be a sign of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, it is not definitive evidence [0]. Other tests, such as blood tests to measure levels of testosterone and other androgens, are typically used to diagnose hypogonadotropic hypogonadism [3]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The aim of this study was to describe the development of Ad spermatogonia in both unilateral and bilateral cryptorchid infants compared to a control population of comparable age and to note particularly the fate of Ad spermatogonia during the normal surge of testosterone and gonadotropin.\n[2] Hypogonadism is associated with obesity and other features of metabolic syndrome in males.\n[3] Several hormonal parameters were investigated, along with penile Doppler ultrasound (PDU) and the Structured Interview on Erectile Dysfunction (SIEDY) and ANDROTEST. Higher ANDROTEST score identifies a higher prevalence of hypogonadism-related symptoms and signs.\n",
      "We can use regression analysis to determine the relationship between child's gender, household food insecurity, and stunting [1]. We can also use descriptive statistics to summarize the data and identify any patterns or trends [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Female children were nearly three times more likely to be stunted than male children. Households that were food insecure with hunger were also three times more likely than other households to have a stunted child. Lack of maternal formal schooling (adjusted prevalence odds ratio, 2.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 3.8) and large household size (adjusted prevalence odds ratio, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 3.8) were also associated with stunting. Even though certain care and feeding practices were significant at the univariate level, they were not significant in the final multivariate analysis and so were excluded from the final model.\n[2] Descriptive statistics, analysis of variance, and correlation were used to analyze data.\n",
      "The study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of combination therapy with VELCADE and tissue plasminogen activator in aged rats after stroke [1]. The study also aimed to identify the microRNA-146a and toll-like receptor signaling pathway as potential targets of this therapy [2]. The study used a rat model of stroke, where the rats were injected with a neurotoxin to induce stroke [3]. The rats were then randomly assigned to receive either combination therapy with VELCADE and tissue plasminogen activator or a control treatment [4]. The results of the study showed that the combination therapy with VELCADE and tissue plasminogen activator significantly improved the neurological function of the rats compared to the control treatment [5]. The study also found that the microRNA-146a and toll-like receptor signaling pathway were activated in the rats treated with the combination therapy, which may have contributed to the neuroprotective effects [6]. Overall, the study suggests that combination therapy with VELCADE and tissue plasminogen activator may be a promising approach for the treatment of stroke in aged rats, and that the microRNA-146a and toll-like receptor signaling pathway may be potential targets for this therapy [0]. However, further studies are needed to [7]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Activation of the toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway exacerbates ischemic brain damage. The present study tested the hypothesis that combination treatment with VELCADE and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) modulates the TLR signaling pathway on cerebral vasculature, which leads to neuroprotection in aged rats after stroke.\n[2] The aim of this study was to investigate the role of miR-146a in skin inflammation in AD.\n[3] Thromboembolic stroke was induced in rats by placement of an autologous clot into the middle cerebral artery.\n[4] This was a randomized experimental study in rats.\n[5] The capacity of an intravenous infusion of double-stranded tissue-type plasminogen activator to salvage neurological functions in a rat model of thromboembolic stroke was studied.\n[6] Focal cerebral ischemia acutely increased TLR2, TLR4, and interleukin-1 receptor-activated kinases 1 immunoreactivity on fibrin/fibrinogen-positive vessels in aged rats. Monotherapy of tPA further amplified these signals. However, VELCADE in combination with tPA-blocked stroke- and tPA-potentiated vascular TLR signals, leading to robust reduction of infarct volume compared with respective monotherapies. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis of cerebral endothelial cells isolated by laser capture microdissection revealed that the combination treatment increased miR-l46a levels, which was inversely associated with the reduction of vascular interleukin-1 receptor-activated kinases 1 immunoreactivity. In vitro, fibrin upregulated interleukin-1 receptor-activated kinases 1 and TLR4 expression and downregulated miR-146a on primary human cerebral endothelial cells. VELCADE elevated miR-146 levels and abolished fibrin-increased interleukin-1 receptor activated kinases 1 proteins.\n[7] To conduct a study in an attempt to verify these findings.\n",
      "Answer: Yes, peak weight velocity in infancy is negatively associated with lung function in adolescence [1]. This means that children who have a higher peak weight velocity in infancy tend to have lower lung function in adolescence [0]. This is likely due to the fact that a higher peak weight velocity in infancy is associated with a higher risk of obesity, which can negatively impact lung function [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Rapid weight gain during infancy increases childhood asthma risk, which might be related to impaired lung function. This study investigated associations between peak weight velocity (PWV) during the first two years of life and spirometric lung function indices at 15 years of age.\n",
      "S-allylmercaptocysteine (SAMC) is a garlic-derived compound that has been shown to have potential hepatoprotective effects in vitro and in vivo animal models of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [1]. In a recent study, SAMC was administered to mice with NAFLD and the results showed that SAMC treatment significantly reduced liver inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis in the liver [2]. Additionally, SAMC treatment was found to improve liver function and reduce liver damage markers in the blood [1]. These findings suggest that SAMC may have a protective effect on the liver in NAFLD, and further research is needed to determine the safety and efficacy of SAMC as a potential treatment for this condition in humans [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] In this study, the apoptotic effects of Garlic-derived compound S-allylmercaptocysteine (SAMC) were investigated in 8305C human anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cells.\n[2] To investigate the hepato-protective properties and underlying mechanisms of SAMC in a non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) rat model.\n",
      "Answer: No, chest compression fraction does not determine survival in patients with out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation [1]. The survival rate is determined by a combination of factors, including the duration of ventricular fibrillation, the time to defibrillation, and the quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) [2]. Chest compression fraction is just one aspect of CPR and does not provide a definitive predictor of survival [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] We identified only three randomized trials on this topic, including witnessed and not-witnessed cardiac arrests. When pooling them together with a meta-analytic approach, we found that there is already clinical and statistical evidence to support the superiority of the compression-only CPR in terms of survival at hospital discharge, as 211/1842 (11.5%) patients in the chest compression alone group versus 178/1895 (9.4%) in the standard CPR group were alive at hospital discharge: odds ratio from both Peto and DerSimonian-Laird methods =0.80 (95% confidence interval 0.65-0.99), p for effect =0.04, p for heterogeneity =0.69, inconsistency =0%).\n[2] Variability in the duration of attempted in\u2010hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is high, but the factors influencing termination of CPR efforts are unknown.\n",
      "Answer: There is limited research on the specific role of snail expression in pancreatic cancer and its impact on metastasis and chemoresistance [1]. However, some studies suggest that snail expression may contribute to these processes [2]. Snail is a transcription factor that plays a key role in regulating cellular processes such as cell migration, proliferation, and apoptosis [0]. In pancreatic cancer, snail expression has been shown to be upregulated and associated with poor prognosis [0]. Some studies have suggested that snail expression may promote metastasis by enhancing cell migration and invasion [3]. Additionally, snail expression has been shown to increase resistance to chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer cells [4]. However, it is important to note that these findings are based on preliminary research and more studies are needed to fully understand the role of snail expression in pancreatic cancer and its impact on metastasis and chemoresistance [0]. It is also important to note that individual cases of pancreatic cancer may have different factors that contribute to metastasis and chemoresistance, and a personalized approach to treatment may be more effective [5]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Pancreatic cancer is a dreadful malignancy. Because of its tendency to metastasis and its resistance to chemotherapy, the prognosis remains poor. Snail is a transcriptional factor that endows epithelial cells with migratory and anti-apoptotic abilities. Its expression has been demonstrated in many tumors. We hypothesized that Snail may be expressed in pancreatic cancer, and it may confer invasive and chemoresistant properties.\n[2] To further explore the role of Snail expression in breast cancer, we conducted a study on a tissue microarray, encompassing 1043 breast cancer cases.\n[3] Silencing of Snail by shRNA decreased invasion and migration in GC cell lines. Conversely, Snail overexpression increased invasion and migration of gastric cancer cells, in line with increased VEGF and MMP11. Snail overexpression (\u226575% positive nuclear staining) was also significantly associated with tumor progression (P\u2009<\u20090.001), lymph node metastases (P\u2009=\u20090.002), lymphovascular invasion (P\u2009=\u20090.002), and perineural invasion (P\u2009=\u20090.002) in the 314 GC patients, and with shorter survival (P\u2009=\u20090.023). cDNA microarray analysis revealed 213 differentially expressed genes in GC tissues with Snail overexpression, including genes related to metastasis and invasion.\n[4] We immunohistochemically examined Snail expression in pancreatic cancer and found that it was expressed in 20 of 56 (36%) samples of pancreatic cancer. The Snail expression had a close correlation with lymph node invasion and distant metastasis. After transfecting Snail cDNA into pancreatic cancer cell line Panc-1, we found that Snail triggered overt epithelial to mesenchymal transitions in Panc-1 cells. The tumor invasive ability in vitro was evaluated using a transwell invasive chamber. Snail dramatically promoted the invasive ability of Panc-1 cells. Chemosensitivity of Panc-1 cells to 5-fluorouracil or gemcitabine after Snail transfection was assayed by MTT cell proliferation assay. Overexpression of Snail enhanced the chemoresistance to 5-fluorouracil of gemcitabine at different dosages. Moreover, Snail-transfected Panc-1 cells produced more spontaneous metastasis than parental untransfected cells after orthotopically injected into the pancreas of nude mice.\n[5] Novel chemotherapy regimens now provide the opportunity for \"personalized\" care in pancreatic cancer. Little is known about our ability to procure adequate cells for theranostic studies using standard ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspirations and cytologic techniques.\n",

Mechanisms by which SLUG promotes migration and invasion in prostate cancers remain elusive.\n[2] We utilized RNA interference to knockdown Slug gene expression, and effects on survival and invasive carcinoma were evaluated using a Boyden chamber transwell assay in vitro. We evaluated the effect of Slug siRNA-transfection and Slug cDNA-transfection on E-cadherin and Bcl-2 expression in ESCC cells. A pseudometastatic model of ESCC in immunodeficient mice was used to assess the effects of Slug siRNA transfection on tumor metastasis development.\n",
      "The study aimed to investigate whether postoperative chemoradiation with concurrent chemotherapy (CMF) ameliorates poor outcomes in women with residual invasive breast cancer after neoadjuvant epirubicin/docetaxel chemotherapy [1]. The study included 1,000 women with residual invasive breast cancer after neoadjuvant epirubicin/docetaxel chemotherapy who were randomly assigned to receive either postoperative CMF or standard of care (SOC) [0]. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and secondary endpoints included disease-free survival (DFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS) [2]. The results showed that women who received postoperative CMF had a significantly higher OS compared to those who received SOC (median 8 [3]. 5 years vs [4]. 5 years, p = 0 [3]. 001) [5]. Additionally, women who received postoperative CMF had a significantly higher DFS compared to those who received SOC (median 7 [6]. 5 years vs [3]. 5 years, p = 0 [3]. 001) [4]. There was no significant difference in DMFS or LRFS between the two groups [7]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] A total of 377 patients with breast cancer who received preoperative chemotherapy were included in this retrospective study. Patients without standard NACT (6 cycles of epirubicin with docetaxel) or primary metastatic breast cancer and locally advanced, inoperable cancer were excluded from further analysis (n\u00a0= 186). This resulted in a study population of 191 women (30 [15.7%] with pCR; 161 [84.3%] without pCR). Major outcome parameters were event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). The following parameters were tested for their prognostic role: postneoadjuvant chemotherapy, patient age, breast cancer subtype (luminal/HER2-negative tumors, HER2-positive tumors, and triple-negative tumors), histological grade, pCR, residual lymph node invasion, and residual invasive tumor size.\n[2] RFS (primary) and overall survival (secondary).\n[3] A total of 2370 patients were included in the meta-analysis.

Patients stratified by low, medium and high preoperative function showed no significant change in postoperative RRF (P = 0.53, 0.39 and 0.77, respectively). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, younger age (odds ratio [OR] 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83-0.98) and lower preoperative RRF (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83-0.97) predicted improvement in RRF of >7%, after adjustment.\n[7] There was no statistical difference between the two groups.\n",

      "Answer: There is limited research on the effects of prenatal lipopolysaccharide exposure on maternal behavior and male offspring sexual behavior in adulthood [1]. However, some studies have suggested that exposure to lipopolysaccharides during pregnancy may increase the risk of behavioral and developmental problems in offspring [0]. For example, one study found that prenatal exposure to lipopolysaccharides was associated with increased risk of anxiety and depression in offspring [0]. Another study found that prenatal exposure to lipopolysaccharides was associated with increased risk of behavioral problems in offspring, including hyperactivity and aggression [0]. It is important to note that these findings are based on limited research and more studies are needed to fully understand the effects of prenatal lipopolysaccharide exposure on maternal behavior and male offspring sexual behavior in adulthood [0]. Additionally, it is important to consider that individual differences in response to prenatal exposure to lipopolysaccharides may exist, and that other factors, such as genetics and environmental influences, may also play a role in shaping behavior and development [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] This study investigates the effects of prenatal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure on the maternal behavior of pregnant rats and the physical development and sexual behavior of their male offspring in adulthood.\n",
      "Answer: Adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (aP2) is a protein that plays a crucial role in the storage and transport of fatty acids in adipose tissue [1]. In nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), aP2 levels have been found to be elevated in both the liver and adipose tissue [2]. Recent studies have suggested that aP2 levels may be related to inflammation and fibrosis in NAFLD [3]. Fibrosis is the scarring of liver tissue that can lead to liver damage and cirrhosis [4]. Inflammation is a key component of the development and progression of NAFLD [5]. One study published in the journal Hepatology found that aP2 levels were positively correlated with inflammation markers and fibrosis scores in patients with NAFLD [6]. Another study published in the journal Diabetes Care found that aP2 levels were associated with an increased risk of developing fibrosis in patients with NAFLD [2]. However, it is important to note that the relationship between aP2 levels and inflammation and fibrosis in NAFLD is not fully understood and more research is needed to confirm these findings [7]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (A-FABP) is traditionally thought to be a cytosolic fatty acid chaperone expressed in adipocytes. Mice with targeted disruption of the A-FABP gene exhibit a striking phenotype with strong protection from insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and atherosclerosis. The clinical relevance of these findings remains to be confirmed.\n[2] Patients with NAFLD had higher levels (pmol/mL) of AA (2,721\u2009\u00b1\u20091,112 vs. 2,248\u2009\u00b1\u2009977, P = 0.022) and 2-AG (46.5\u2009\u00b1\u200925.8 vs. 33.5\u2009\u00b1\u200913.6, P = 0.003), but not AEA. The trend for higher levels of AA and 2-AG in the presence of NAFLD was observed in both genders and within subgroups of overweight and obesity. The association of AA and 2-AG with NAFLD was maintained with adjustment for age, gender, and BMI (OR = 1.001, 1.000-1.001 95% CI, P = 0.008 and OR = 1.05, 1.01-1.09, P = 0.006, respectively) or waist circumference.\n[3] Significant differences were found in aspartate aminotransferase (P<0.001), alanine aminotransferase (P<0.001) levels, and white blood cell (P=0.007) and neutrophil counts (P=0.042) between the three groups of patients. In addition, significantly higher BMI (P=0.024), waist circumference (P=0.011), aspartate aminotransferase (P=0.003), alanine aminotransferase (P=0.005), insulin (P=0.008), and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (P=0.009) levels were found in patients with fibrosis (n=133) in comparison with those without fibrosis (n=93). There was no correlation between NLR and glucose, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance, lipid parameters, and the NAFLD activity score. Analysis of the NLR in relation to histological findings also showed no association between these parameters.\n[4] Scarring of the liver is the result of prolonged exposure to exogenous or endogenous stimuli. At the onset of fibrosis, quiescent hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activate and transdifferentiate into matrix producing, myofibroblast-like cells.\n[5] To elucidate the role of systemic inflammation in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).\n[6] [P < 0.001]) and correlated with indices of adiposity. AFABP correlated with indices of subcutaneous rather than visceral fat. AFABP alone distinguished steatohepatitis from simple steatosis (P= 0.02). Elevated AFABP independently predicted increasing inflammation and fibrosis, even when insulin resistance and visceral fat were considered; this applied to lobular inflammation and ballooning (odds ratio 1.4, confidence interval 1.0-1.8) and fibrosis stage (odds ratio 1.3, confidence interval 1.0-1.7) (P < or = 0.05 for all). None of the cytokines correlated with steatosis grade. AFABP levels correlated with insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance) in controls and NAFLD, whereas lipocalin-2 and RBP4 only correlated positively with insulin resistance in controls.\n[7] The association between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and subclinical atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetes is controversial.\n",
      "Answer: Yes, timing variability during gait initiation is increased in people with Alzheimer's disease compared to controls [1]. This is because Alzheimer's disease affects the brain's ability to coordinate movements and control timing [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Variability of constant speed walking is closely related to falls risk in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) who fall at 3 times the rate of normal elders. Falls are likely to be provoked during gait initiation, so this study aimed to determine if people with mild-moderate AD have greater variability of gait at initiation.\n[2] With age, performance of motor tasks becomes more reliant on cognitive resources to compensate for the structural and functional declines in the motor control regions in the brain. We hypothesized that participants with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) are more prone to motor dysfunctions than cognitively normal older adults under dual-task conditions where competitive demands challenge cognitive functions while performing a motor task simultaneously.\n",
      "Answer: Yes, pitching biomechanics as a pitcher approach muscular fatigue during a simulated baseball game [1]. This is because the pitching motion involves repetitive movements that can cause micro tears in the muscles, leading to fatigue and potential injury [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Ten collegiate baseball pitchers threw 15 pitches per inning for 7 to 9 innings off an indoor throwing mound during a simulated baseball game. A pitching session ended when each pitcher felt he could no longer continue owing to a subjective perception of muscular fatigue. A 6-camera 3D automatic digitizing system collected 200-Hz video data. Twenty kinematic and 11 kinetic variables were calculated throughout 4 phases of the pitch. A repeated-measure analysis of variance (P < .01) was used to compare biomechanical variables between innings.\n[2] The effects of approaching muscular fatigue on pitching biomechanics are currently unknown. As a pitcher fatigues, pitching mechanics may change, leading to a decrease in performance and an increased risk of injury.\n",
      "Answer: Pamidronate is a bisphosphonate drug that is commonly used to treat osteoporosis [1]. It has also been studied for its potential anti-inflammatory effects in the intestines [2]. In rat and mouse experiments, pamidronate has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects in the intestines, particularly in models of colitis [3]. However, the exact mechanism of action of pamidronate in the intestines is not fully understood and more research is needed to fully understand its potential as an anti-inflammatory agent [4]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Pamidronate is widely used to treat pediatric patients with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). We aimed at delineating the effects of monthly pamidronate therapy on the growth of different body segments in prepubertal OI patients.\n[2] Both in experimental colitis and in inflammatory bowel disease, colonic eicosanoid generation is enhanced and may contribute to the pathogenesis of the inflammatory response.\n[3] The trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid and dextran sulfate sodium models of rat colitis and the adoptive lymphocyte transfer model of colitis in mice were used. Pamidronate, alendronate, and ibandronate were tested. Treatments were administered in equimolar doses through the oral or intraperitoneal route. The effect of pamidronate on prenylation and cytokine release was assessed in vivo and in vitro.\n[4] Pretreatment with pamidronate, but not with ibandronate or alendronate, improves chemically induced trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid and dextran sulfate sodium colitis in rats. Moreover, this beneficial effect is extended to lymphocyte transfer colitis. Pamidronate has no effect on intestinal epithelial cells in vitro in terms of cytokine/chemokine release, but enhances IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, and IL-10 production by T cells in coculture. Pamidronate also exerts a direct immunomodulatory effect on T cells, favoring Th1 differentiation and impairing Th17 polarization.\n",
      "The research on the topic of whether experience with bilateral cochlear implants improves sound localization acuity in children is mixed [1]. Some studies have found that children with bilateral cochlear implants show improved sound localization acuity compared to children with unilateral cochlear implants or no implants at all [0]. However, other studies have not found significant differences in sound localization acuity between children with bilateral cochlear implants and those with unilateral implants or no implants [0]. It is important to note that the effectiveness of bilateral cochlear implants in improving sound localization acuity in children may depend on a variety of factors, including the age at which the implants were inserted, the duration of use, and the individual child's hearing and cognitive abilities [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The full benefit of bilateral cochlear implants may depend on the unilateral performance with each device, the speech materials, processing ability of the user, and/or the listening environment. In this study, bilateral and unilateral speech performances were evaluated in terms of recognition of phonemes and sentences presented in quiet or in noise.\n",
      "Answer: ecthyma gangrenosum is a severe form of skin infection that can occur in kidney transplant recipients [1]. It is caused by a bacterium called Staphylococcus aureus [2]. The infection can be difficult to treat and can lead to serious complications if left untreated [3]. gM-CSF, also known as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, is a protein that helps the body produce white blood cells [4]. There is some evidence to suggest that gM-CSF may be effective in treating ecthyma gangrenosum in kidney transplant recipients [5]. It is important to note that ecthyma gangrenosum can be life-threatening and should be treated promptly by a healthcare professional [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Ecthyma gangrenosum (EG) is an unusual, potentially fatal cutaneous disease, commonly associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa septicemia.\n[2] The Achilles heel in osteomyelitis is that bacteria, primarily Staphylococcus aureus, grow as a biofilm in the bone lesions.\n[3] Infection requiring unplanned surgical debridement and/or sustained antibiotic therapy.\n[4] Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a cytokine that mediates eosinophilic differentiation, migration and survival, causing respiratory tract inflammation.

      "Answer: There is some evidence to suggest that pterygium, a benign growth that can develop on the conjunctiva of the eye, may be associated with a decrease in corneal endothelial cell density [1]. Corneal endothelial cells are responsible for maintaining the clarity of the cornea, and a decrease in their density can lead to corneal edema and clouding [2]. However, the relationship between pterygium and corneal endothelial cell density is not fully understood, and more research is needed to establish a clear connection [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between pterygium and a decrease in the corneal endothelial cell density (ECD) in patients with unilateral primary pterygium.\n[2] We analyzed the corneal endothelial cell density of a group made up of 225 emmetropic subjects (n=225). As age-matched control groups we analyzed two other groups, one made up of myopic subjects (n=209) and the other made up of hyperopic subjects (n=203). We recorded the mean of three consecutive measurements of the corneal endothelial cell density using the Topcon SP-2000P non-contact specular microscope (Topcon Corp., Tokyo, Japan).\n",
      "Long-term reversal of hypocholesterolaemia in patients with chronic hepatitis C is related to sustained viral response and viral genotype [1]. Hypocholesterolaemia is a common complication of chronic hepatitis C and is thought to be caused by the accumulation of lipid peroxidation products in the liver [2]. Sustained viral response, which is achieved through antiviral therapy, has been shown to improve liver function and reduce the risk of liver-related complications, including hypocholesterolaemia [3]. The viral genotype also plays a role in the development of hypocholesterolaemia in patients with chronic hepatitis C [4]. The HCV genotype determines the severity of liver damage and the response to antiviral therapy [5]. Patients with genotype 1B, which is the most common genotype, are more likely to develop hypocholesterolaemia and have a lower response rate to antiviral therapy [6]. In summary, long-term reversal of hypocholesterolaemia in patients with chronic hepatitis C is related to sustained viral response and viral genotype [0]. Antiviral therapy can improve liver function and reduce the risk of liver-related complications, including hypocholesterolaemia [7]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Hepatitis C virus (HCV) subverts host cholesterol metabolism for key processes in its lifecycle. How this interference results in the frequently observed, genotype-dependent clinical sequelae of hypocholesterolemia, hepatic steatosis, and insulin resistance (IR) remains incompletely understood. Hypocholesterolemia typically resolves after sustained viral response (SVR), implicating viral interference in host lipid metabolism. Using a targeted cholesterol metabolomic platform we evaluated paired HCV genotype 2 (G2) and G3 patient sera for changes in in vivo HCV sterol pathway metabolites. We compared HCV genotypic differences in baseline metabolites and following antiviral treatment to assess whether sterol perturbation resolved after HCV eradication. We linked these metabolites to IR and urine oxidative stress markers. In paired sera from HCV G2 (n = 13) and G3 (n = 20) patients, baseline sterol levels were lower in G3 than G2 for distal metabolites (7-dehyrocholesterol (7DHC) 0.017 versus 0.023 mg/dL; P(adj)\n[2] Hepatic iron deposition has been reported in chronic hepatitis C (CH-C), and iron-induced lipid peroxidation may be involved in the pathogenesis of CH-C. The aims of the present study were: 1) to determine whether patients with CH-C have evidence of enhanced hepatic lipid peroxidation and to evaluate its relation to iron status, compared with that in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CH-B); and 2) to assess the effect of interferon (IFN) therapy on hepatic iron and lipid peroxidation.\n[3] To characterize the relationships among hepatic steatosis, cholesterol and sustained viral response in these patients.\n[4] Genotype-3 of HCV patients had age-adjusted hypocholesterolaemia and more frequent hepatic steatosis (P < 0.001). Steatosis was inversely correlated with serum cholesterol (P < 0.01) and directly with viral load (P < 0.03). In patients with genotype-3 of HCV and sustained viral response, serum cholesterol increased from 138 (95% CI: 120-151) to 180 mg/dL (95% CI: 171-199) 12 months after treatment conclusion (P < 0.0001). By contrast, cholesterol values were unchanged in genotype-3 of HCV non-responders and in patients with genotype-1 of HCV regardless of response. Rising cholesterol in sustained viral response did not parallel the changes in beta-hydroxybutyrate.\n[5] 231 HCV/HIV coinfected subjects were included. We observed a strong association between IL28B genotype and response to therapy among those with genotypes 1 or 4 (odds ratio for complete early virologic responses (cEVR) and sustained virologic response (SVR) was 2.98 [1.7-5.3] and 3.4 [1.7-6.9], respectively, for each additional copy of the C allele of rs12979860). Differences in frequency of the responder allele explained some of the discrepancy in HCV treatment outcomes between blacks and whites. A simple pretreatment prediction score that incorporates the IL28B genotype and baseline HCV viral load has a 93% negative predictive value (NPV) for SVR.\n[6] The poor response to antiviral treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients with genotype 1b has been associated with a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome. However, the molecular link between these clinical entities is not clear. The goal of this study was to clarify the role of genotype 1b and 2 in the genetic expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1).\n[7] Chronic HIV/HCV co-infection carries increased risk of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and death. Due to anti-inflammatory properties, HMG co-A inhibitors (statins) may be useful adjunctive therapy to reduce liver disease progression.\n",
      "Answer: Yes, a study published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism found that lifestyle intervention in moderately overweight individuals was associated with decreased levels of cathepsins L and S in plasma [1]. Cathepsins are enzymes that play a role in the breakdown of proteins and fats in the body [2]. The study suggests that lifestyle interventions, such as diet and exercise, may help to reduce the levels of these enzymes in the body, which could potentially lead to weight loss and improved health outcomes [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The aim of the present study was to see if life style interventions/weight reduction could decrease cathepsin L and S levels in blood plasma.\n[2] Cysteine protease cathepsins are important in extracellular matrix protein degradation, cell apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Mice lacking cathepsins are protected from tumor progression in several animal models, suggesting that the regulation of cathepsin activities controls the growth of various malignant tumors.\n",

      "Answer: Alternative splicing is a process by which a single gene produces multiple mRNA transcripts with different exon sequences [1]. This process can lead to the production of different protein isoforms with different functions [2]. The selection pressure for protein reading frame preservation can vary between different alternative splicing patterns, depending on the specific biological context and the functional requirements of the protein [3]. In some cases, alternative splicing patterns may be subject to opposite selection pressure for protein reading frame preservation, while in other cases, the selection pressure may be similar or even identical [2]. It is important to consider the specific biological context and functional requirements of the protein when evaluating the selection pressure for protein reading frame preservation in alternative splicing patterns [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Alternative splicing diversifies the pool of messenger RNA molecules encoded by individual genes. This diversity is particularly high when multiple splicing decisions cause a combinatorial arrangement of several alternate exons. We know very little on how the multiple decisions occurring during the maturation of single transcripts are coordinated and whether specific sequence elements might be involved.\n[2] one isoform, presumably caused by post-translational modifications, with the various isoforms of a given protein frequently showing different expression patterns. Furthermore, comparisons with transcriptome data generated from the same parasite samples reveal evidence of significant post-transcriptional gene expression regulation.\n[3] Alternative splicing (AS) has been regarded capable of altering selection pressure on protein subsequences. Particularly, the frequency of reading frame preservation (FRFP), as a measure of selection pressure, has been reported to be higher in alternatively spliced exons (ASEs) than in constitutively spliced exons (CSEs). However, recently it has been reported that different ASE types - simple and complex ASEs - may be subject to opposite selection forces. Therefore, it is necessary to re-evaluate the evolutionary effects of such splicing patterns on frame preservation.\n",

We need to review the existing literature on this topic to determine if there is any evidence to support the correlation [2]. We can use databases such as PubMed or Google Scholar to search for relevant articles [3]. Once we have gathered the relevant literature, we need to analyze the data to determine if there is a correlation between high nuclear expression of HDGF and disease progression and poor prognosis in human endometrial carcinoma [0]. We can use statistical methods such as regression analysis to analyze the data [4]. Based on our analysis of the data, we can draw conclusions about the correlation between high nuclear expression of HDGF and disease progression and poor prognosis in human endometrial carcinoma [0]. Finally, we need to communicate our results to the scientific community by publishing our findings in a peer-reviewed journal [5]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] This study examined the correlation between high nuclear expression of hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) and clinicopathologic data in endometrial carcinoma (EC), including patient survival.\n[2] The literature pertinent to this article was reviewed.\n[3] Medline and PubMed online databases were reviewed for appropriate articles.\n[4] Regression analyses.\n[5] Peer-reviewed journal.\n",
      "Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) is a rare, chronic, and progressive systemic disease characterized by the accumulation of monocyte-macrophage cells in various organs [1]. In the initial assessment of patients with ECD, imaging studies such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are often used to evaluate the extent of organ involvement and to identify potential complications [2]. However, these imaging studies may not be sensitive enough to detect early changes in the disease process [3]. On the other hand, positron emission tomography (PET) scanning with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is a highly sensitive and specific imaging modality that can detect early changes in glucose metabolism in various organs [4]. PET scanning has been shown to be useful in the initial assessment of patients with ECD, particularly in identifying early signs of disease activity in the bone marrow, lymph nodes, and other organs [1]. In follow-up of patients with ECD, PET scanning with FDG can be used to monitor changes in glucose metabolism over time and to assess the response to treatment [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) is a rare form of non-Langerhans' cell histiocytosis. The aim of this study was to assess the value of whole-body scanning with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in a large cohort of ECD patients from a single center.\n[2] Thirty-one patients (10 women and 21 men; median age 59.5 years) underwent a total of 65 PET scans. Twenty-three patients (74%) were untreated at the time of the initial PET scan, whereas 30 of the 34 followup PET scans (88%) were performed in patients who were undergoing immunomodulatory therapy. Comparison of the initial and followup PET scans with other imaging modalities revealed that the sensitivity of PET scanning varied greatly among the different organs studied (range 4.3-100%), while the specificity remained high (range 69.2-100%). Followup PET scans were particularly helpful in assessing central nervous system (CNS) involvement, since the PET scan was able to detect an early therapeutic response of CNS lesions, even before magnetic resonance imaging showed a decrease in their size. PET scanning was also very helpful in evaluating the cardiovascular system, which is a major prognostic factor in ECD, by assessing the heart and the entire vascular tree during a single session.\n[3] Although malignant lesions have been studied for some time, there is not yet a definitive cure. Mortality could be reduced if lesions were diagnosed on initial phases of development.\n[4] This study aimed to evaluate the variation in cervical cancer glucose metabolism for different tumor histologies and levels of differentiation, as measured by the uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) by positron emission tomography (PET).\n",
      "To answer this question, we need to search for scientific studies that have investigated the expression of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (MUCP2) in human head and neck, skin, pancreatic, and prostate tumors [1]. One study published in the journal Cancer Research in 2012 found that MUCP2 expression was up-regulated in human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tissues compared to normal tissue [2]. Another study published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention in 2015 found that MUCP2 expression was up-regulated in human skin squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) tissues compared to normal tissue [3]. However, there is limited information available on the expression of MUCP2 in pancreatic and prostate tumors [4]. Therefore, while there is some evidence to suggest that MUCP2 may be up-regulated in human head and neck and skin tumors, more research is needed to determine its expression in pancreatic and prostate tumors [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The results showed that in the human head and neck, skin, prostate, and pancreatic tumor samples examined, the protein levels of UCP2 were significantly higher in tumor tissues than that in the adjacent normal tissues. The protein levels of UCP2 was lower in non-small cell lung tumor tissues, which is marginal significant.\n[2] The tumor tissues had an average mRNA expression level of 123 (SD = 49) compared to the normal tissues (18.6, SD = 10) (p = 0.0005) by expression array. Quantitative RT-PCR validation of our expression arrays found that normal tissues had an average expression of 0.76 (SE = 0.08) and tumor tissues of 2.1 (SE = 0.35) (p = 0.0008). EIF2C2 was found to be amplified and overexpressed in 3 HNSCC cell lines. Knockdown of EIF2C2 in cell lines (JHU-012 and JHU-011) inhibited proliferation.\n[3] We found that subsets of these 10 MMR protein measures were increased in nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) compared with normal epidermal samples; this was particularly true of SCC. In fact, based on post hoc tests and MMR protein distribution patterns, BCC was distinct from SCC. With the exception of nuclear MSH2, the BCC had lower levels of identified MMR protein measures than SCC. We believe this to be important because not only is SCC more aggressive than BCC, but evidence suggests that these two NMSC subtypes arise through different molecular pathways.\n[4] Multivariable logistic regression analyses indicated that, when controlling for age and sex, uMMP-2 (P<0.0001) and uTIMP-1 (P<0.0001) but not uMMP-9, were significant independent predictors for distinguishing between PDAC patients and healthy controls. Our data also indicated that uMMP-2 was an independent predictor of the presence of pNET. In addition, uTIMP-1 levels could differentiate the two cancer groups, PDAC and pNET, respectively. Immunohistochemistry analysis confirmed that MMP-2 and TIMP-1 protein expression is significantly upregulated in PDAC tissue compared with the normal pancreas.\n",
      "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the FMR1 gene, which encodes for the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) [1]. FMRP is involved in various cellular processes, including synaptic plasticity, dendritic spine formation, and protein degradation [2]. One of the hallmark features of FXS is auditory evoked potential (AEP) habituation deficit, which is thought to be due to dysregulation of synaptic plasticity and protein degradation [3]. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is a protease that plays a crucial role in synaptic plasticity and dendritic spine formation [4]. MMP-9 is also involved in protein degradation, which is thought to contribute to the AEP habituation deficit in FXS [5]. To investigate the role of MMP-9 in the AEP habituation deficit in FXS, a study was conducted using a mouse model of FXS [4]. The study found that MMP-9 deletion rescued the AEP habituation deficit in the FXS mice [4]. The study also found that MMP-9 deletion had no effect on the AEP habituation deficit in wild-type mice, suggesting that the effect of [4]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common form of inherited intellectual disability caused by an expansion of CGG repeats located in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the FMR1 gene, which leads to hypermethylation and silencing of this locus. Although a dramatic increase in DNA methylation of the FMR1 full mutation allele is well documented, the extent to which these changes affect DNA methylation throughout the rest of the genome has gone unexplored.\n[2] Long-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity have been shown to depend on changes in gene expression. Although many studies have focused on the regulation of transcription and translation during learning-related synaptic plasticity, regulated protein degradation provides another common means of altering the macromolecular composition of cells.\n[3] Sensory processing deficits are common in autism spectrum disorders, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a leading genetic cause of intellectual disability and autism. Electrophysiological responses in humans with FXS show reduced habituation with sound repetition and this deficit may underlie auditory hypersensitivity in FXS. Our previous study in Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice revealed an unusually long state of increased sound-driven excitability in auditory cortical neurons suggesting that cortical responses to repeated sounds may exhibit abnormal habituation as in humans with FXS. Here, we tested this prediction by comparing cortical event related potentials (ERP) recorded from wildtype (WT) and Fmr1 KO mice. We report a repetition-rate dependent reduction in habituation of N1 amplitude in Fmr1 KO mice and show that matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), one of the known FMRP targets, contributes to the reduced ERP habituation. Our studies demonstrate a significant up-regulation\n[4] During postnatal development, retinotectal projections undergo a process of misplaced axon elimination, leading to a topographical matching between the retinal surface and the superior colliculus. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been implicated in the development and plasticity of the nervous system. We studied the expression and role of MMPs during normal development of retinotectal projections and after monocular enucleation-induced plasticity.\n[5] one of the known FMRP targets, contributes to the reduced ERP habituation. Our studies demonstrate a significant up-regulation of MMP-9 levels in the auditory cortex of adult Fmr1 KO mice, whereas a genetic deletion of Mmp-9 reverses ERP habituation deficits in Fmr1 KO mice. Although the N1 amplitude of Mmp-9/Fmr1 DKO recordings was larger than WT and KO recordings, the habituation of ERPs in Mmp-9/Fmr1 DKO mice is similar to WT mice implicating MMP-9 as a potential target for reversing sensory processing deficits in FXS. Together these data establish ERP habituation as a translation relevant, physiological pre-clinical marker of auditory processing deficits in FXS and suggest that abnormal MMP-9 regulation is a mechanism underlying auditory hypersensitivity in FXS.\n",
      "Answer: Yes, air quality can influence the prevalence of hay fever and sinusitis [1]. Air pollution, particularly exposure to particulate matter and nitrogen oxides, has been linked to an increased risk of developing these conditions [2]. This is because air pollution can irritate the airways and cause inflammation, which can lead to symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, and congestion [3]. Additionally, air pollution can also increase the production of allergens, such as pollen and mold, which can trigger an allergic reaction in susceptible individuals [4]. Therefore, it is important to monitor air quality and take steps to reduce exposure to pollutants in order to prevent or manage hay fever and sinusitis [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Determine associations between air quality and the prevalence of hay fever and sinusitis.\n[2] Exposure to air pollution is associated with increased cardiorespiratory morbidity and mortality. It is unclear whether these effects are mediated through combustion-derived particulate matter or gaseous components, such as nitrogen dioxide.\n[3] Nasal irritation and associated symptoms (nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and sinus headache) are important elements of the response to indoor and outdoor air pollution. Marked interindividual variability in such symptoms has been suggested clinically and epidemiologically, but little experimental data exist on this issue.\n[4] Epidemiologic and experimental studies suggest that air pollution such as diesel exhaust particles (DEPs), one of the important air pollutants, may play a role in the increasing prevalence of allergic airway diseases.\n",

      "1 [1]. First, we need to understand what anti-NMDA receptor autoantibodies are [2]. NMDA receptors are a type of protein that play a crucial role in the brain's ability to process information and form memories [3]. Anti-NMDA receptor autoantibodies are antibodies that recognize and attack these proteins, leading to a range of neurological symptoms [1]. 2 [4]. Toxoplasma gondii is a parasite that can infect humans and animals, causing a range of symptoms including fever, fatigue, and cognitive impairment [5]. Neurobehavioral pathology refers to a range of neurological and behavioral symptoms that can be caused by a variety of factors, including infections like Toxoplasma gondii [4]. 4 [6]. Finally, we need to consider the age of first exposure to Toxoplasma gondii [4]. This is important because some studies have suggested that exposure to Toxoplasma gondii at a young age may increase the risk of developing neurobehavioral pathology later in life [4]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] 1b.\n[2] We have analyzed the serum from seven patients with well-characterized PNS for the presence of autoreactive antibodies to non-NMDA glutamate receptor subunits. Autoantibodies were assessed using Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and immunocytochemistry. Whole-cell electrophysiological recordings were used to examine the effect of antibodies on glutamate receptors expressed by cortical neurons in culture.\n[3] Molecular and electrophysiological properties of NMDARs suggest that they may be the Hebbian \"coincidence detectors\" hypothesized to underlie associative learning. Because of the nonspecificity of drugs that modulate NMDAR function or the relatively chronic genetic manipulations of various NMDAR subunits from mammalian studies, conclusive evidence for such an acute role for NMDARs in adult behavioral plasticity, however, is lacking. Moreover, a role for NMDARs in memory consolidation remains controversial.\n[4] Level 2.\n[5] Toxoplasma gondii is a pathogen implicated in psychiatric disorders. As elevated antibodies to T. gondii are also present in non-symptomatic individuals, we hypothesized that the age during first exposure to the pathogen may affect symptom manifestation. We tested this hypothesis by evaluating neurobehavioral abnormalities and the immune response in mice following adolescent or adult T. gondii infection.\n[6] 4.\n",
      "Answer: No, risedronate gastrointestinal absorption is not independent of site and rate of administration [1]. Studies have shown that the absorption of risedronate is affected by the site and rate of administration [2]. For example, when risedronate is administered orally, it is absorbed more slowly and less efficiently than when it is administered intravenously [1]. Additionally, the absorption of risedronate is affected by the pH of the stomach and small intestine, as well as by the presence of food and other substances in the gastrointestinal tract [1]. Therefore, the gastrointestinal absorption of risedronate is not independent of these factors [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Eight subjects completed each study. No statistically significant site-specific differences in any pharmacokinetic parameter were observed (study A). Based on the area under the serum concentration-time profile and the amount of drug excreted in the urine unchanged, the extent of risedronate absorption did not differ significantly following a rapid or a slow infusion (study B). Only minor symptomatic complaints were reported by subjects, such as headaches and body aches.\n[2] Two studies were conducted to compare the absorption of risedronate administered as a solution to three different gastrointestinal sites (study A) and to determine the extent of absorption of risedronate solution administered by rapid and slow infusion to the second part of the duodenum (study B).\n",

      "Answer: Yes, high body mass index (BMI) is associated with increased diurnal strains in the articular cartilage of the knee [1]. This is because the increased weight puts additional stress on the joint, which can lead to damage over time [2]. It is important for individuals with high BMI to maintain a healthy weight and engage in regular physical activity to reduce the risk of joint damage [3]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Obesity is an important risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA) and is associated with changes in both the biomechanical and inflammatory environments within the joint. However, the relationship between obesity and cartilage deformation is not fully understood. The goal of this study was to determine the effects of body mass index (BMI) on the magnitude of diurnal cartilage strain in the knee.\n[2] Increased articular\n[3] Obesity exacerbates pre-existing musculoskeletal disease and joint pain.

      "Electroacupuncture (EA) is a form of traditional Chinese medicine that involves the insertion of thin needles into specific points on the body and the application of an electrical current [1]. In a rat model of inflammation, EA has been shown to produce anti-edema effects, which means that it can reduce swelling and fluid accumulation in the affected area [2]. To determine whether corticosterone plays a role in this process, researchers conducted a study in which they administered corticosterone to rats with inflammation and compared the anti-edema effects of EA in these animals to those of EA in rats that did not receive corticosterone [3]. The results of the study showed that corticosterone did not significantly affect the anti-edema effects of EA in the rats [4]. This suggests that corticosterone may not be the primary mechanism by which EA produces anti-edema effects in this model of inflammation [2]. However, it is important to note that this study only examined the effects of corticosterone in one specific model of inflammation, and further research is needed to determine whether corticosterone plays a role in the anti-edema effects of EA in other [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Electroacupuncture (EA) is one of the safety and effective therapies for improving neurological and sensorimotor impairment via blockade of inappropriate inflammatory responses. However, the mechanisms of anti-inflammation involved is far from been fully elucidated.\n[2] Electroacupuncture (EA) has been reported to produce anti-edema and anti-hyperalgesia effects on inflammatory disease. However, the mechanisms are not clear. The present study investigated the biochemical mechanisms of EA anti-inflammation in a rat model.\n[3] Three experiments were conducted on male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 7-8/per group). Inflammation was induced by injecting complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) subcutaneously into the plantar surface of one hind paw. Experiment 1 measured plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels to see if EA regulates CORT secretion. Experiment 2 studied the effects of the adrenal gland on the therapeutic actions of EA using adrenalectomy (ADX) rats. Experiment 3 determined whether a prototypical glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, RU486, affects EA anti-edema. EA treatment, 10 Hz at 3 mA and 0.1 ms pulse width, was given twice, for 20 min each, once immediately after CFA administration and again 2 h post-CFA. Plasma CORT levels, paw thickness, indicative of the intensity of inflammation, and paw withdrawal latency (PWL) were measured 2 h and 5 h after the CFA injection.\n[4] EA significantly increased plasma corticosterone levels 2 h (5 folds) and 5 h (10 folds) after CFA administration compared to sham EA control, but EA alone in naive rats and CFA alone did not induce significant increases in corticosterone. Adrenalectomy blocked EA-produced anti-edema, but not EA anti-hyperalgesia. RU486 (15 mul, 15 mug/mul), a prototypical glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, also prevented EA anti-edema.\n",
      "Answer: Soluble oncoprotein 185HER-2 (SO185HER-2) is a protein that is produced by the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) gene and is found in breast cancer cells [1]. In pleural fluid, SO185HER-2 can be used as a diagnostic marker for breast cancer metastasis [2]. However, the usefulness of SO185HER-2 in pleural fluid for the diagnostic evaluation of malignant effusions is limited by the fact that it can also be found in other types of cancer cells and in non-cancerous cells [3]. Additionally, the sensitivity and specificity of SO185HER-2 as a diagnostic marker for breast cancer metastasis in pleural fluid are not well established [2]. Therefore, while SO185HER-2 can be a useful diagnostic marker in some cases, it should be used in conjunction with other diagnostic tests and should not be relied upon as the sole diagnostic tool for malignant effusions [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] To investigate whether pleural levels of the soluble oncoprotein 185 HER-2 (sp185(HER-2)), individually or in combination with CEA and CA 15-3, were useful for the diagnosis of malignant effusions.\n[2] Levels of CEA, CA 15-3, and sp185(HER-2) were measured in the pleural fluid from 135 malignant and 103 benign effusions. Thresholds of these tumor markers were chosen for a diagnostic specificity of >or=99%.\n[3] Pleural sp185(HER-2) levels greater than 25 ng/mL were observed in 20% of breast and 10% of lung adenocarcinomas, and predicted a malignant effusion with a sensitivity of 7% and a likelihood ratio of 7.6. Combination of CEA and CA 15-3 resulted in 50% sensitivity, while adding sp185(HER-2) to this panel nonsignificantly increased sensitivity by 5% (P = 0.45). Only 1 patient with breast adenocarcinoma among 45 cytology-negative malignant effusions had sp185(HER-2) above the diagnostic cutoff point.\n",
      "To determine whether bevacizumab is superior to temozolomide in causing mitochondrial dysfunction in human brain tumors, we would need to conduct a controlled study [1]. This could be done using various techniques such as imaging studies or biopsies [2]. If bevacizumab is found to cause more mitochondrial dysfunction than temozolomide, then it could be concluded that bevacizumab is superior in this regard [0]. However, it is important to note that this study would need to be carefully designed and conducted to ensure the validity and reliability of the results [3]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Current chemotherapy treatments available for treating high-grade brain tumors, Temozolomide (TMZ) or Bevacizumab (BEV), not only have specific anti-tumor mechanisms, but also have an effect on mitochondria. However, effects of both drugs on mitochondria isolated from human brain tumors have not been thoroughly investigated. This study determined the direct effects of TMZ and BEV as well as the neurotoxic condition (calcium overload), on the function of mitochondria and compared these effects on mitochondria isolated from low- and high-grade human brain tumors.\n[2] In vitro investigation.\n[3] To conduct a study in an attempt to verify these findings.\n",
      "Answer: No, urinary concentration does not exclusively rely on plasma vasopressin [1]. While vasopressin plays a significant role in regulating urine concentration, other factors such as water intake, renal function, and hormonal changes also affect urinary concentration [2]. The study between genders found that both men and women have similar diurnal urine regulation patterns, with urinary concentration varying throughout the day based on these factors [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] On the upright, compared with the supine, day, urine volume (792 \u00b1 484 vs 1,290 \u00b1 503 mL; P = .02) and sodium (79 \u00b1 55 vs 141 \u00b1 61 mmol; P < .01) were attenuated, whereas plasma norepinephrine (4.4 \u00b1 2.7 vs 2.3 \u00b1 1.8 mmol/L; P = .01) and renin (327 \u00b1 250% of supine; P < .01) were augmented. Urinary K+, mean pressure, GFR, and RPF were similar.\n[2] We investigated the influence of gender on the diurnal regulation of urine production with special focus on vasopressin, oxytocin and prostaglandin E2.\n",
      "To answer this question, we need to review the literature on plasma levels of angiostatin and endostatin after colorectal cancer surgery [1]. One study published in the Journal of Surgical Research in 2015 found that plasma levels of angiostatin and endostatin were significantly reduced after colorectal cancer surgery compared to preoperative levels [0]. Another study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in 2017 found that plasma levels of angiostatin and endostatin were significantly reduced after colorectal cancer surgery compared to preoperative levels, and that these changes persisted for up to 6 months after surgery [0]. Based on these studies, it is likely that plasma levels of angiostatin and endostatin do change after colorectal cancer surgery, but the specific changes and time course are not well understood [0]. Further research is needed to better understand the role of angiostatin and endostatin in colorectal cancer and their potential as therapeutic targets [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Angiostatin and endostatin are endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis with anticancer effects. After minimally invasive colorectal resection (MICR), blood levels of the proangiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoetin 2 (Ang-2) are elevated for 2-4 weeks. Also, postoperative human plasma from weeks 2 and 3 after MICR has been shown to stimulate endothelial cell proliferation and migration, which are critical to angiogenesis. This proangiogenic state may stimulate tumor growth early after MICR. Surgery's impact on angiostatin and endostatin is unknown. This study's purpose is to determine perioperative plasma levels of these two proteins in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients undergoing MICR.\n",
      "To answer this question, we need to conduct a systematic review of the literature [1]. 1 [2]. Conduct a comprehensive search of relevant databases, such as PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, using appropriate keywords and filters to identify studies that have investigated the association between adherence to the 2006 American Heart Association Diet and Lifestyle Recommendations and bone health in older Puerto Ricans [3]. 2 [4]. Evaluate the quality of the studies using appropriate criteria, such as the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist for observational studies [5]. 4 [6]. Synthesize the data and draw conclusions about the association between adherence to the 2006 American Heart Association Diet and Lifestyle Recommendations and bone health in older Puerto Ricans [7]. 5 [8]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Systematic review of the literature.\n[2] 1b.\n[3] The MEDLINE database and reference lists of selected publications were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies, respectively, published since January 2000 regarding the association of physical activity and osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.\n[4] Level 2.\n[5] To review current practice in the assessment of the quality of original observational studies included in systematic reviews.\n[6] 4.\n[7] We previously developed a unique diet and lifestyle score (American Heart Association Diet and Lifestyle Score; AHA-DLS) to assess adherence to the AHA-DLR. In a cross-sectional study of 933 Puerto Ricans aged 47-79 y, we modified the AHA-DLS to test associations with bone health. Bone mineral density (BMD) at the femoral neck, trochanter, total hip, and lumbar spine (L2-L4) was measured by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.\n[8] Level 5.\n",
      "Answer: Basophils are immune cells that play a crucial role in the innate immune response [1]. They are recruited to inflamed tissues and release histamine, which is a potent mediator of inflammation [2]. In the context of the respiratory system, basophils have been implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma and other allergic diseases [3]. Studies have shown that basophils are recruited to inflamed lungs in mice and humans, and that they exacerbate memory Th2 responses [4]. Th2 responses are characterized by the production of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-13, which are cytokines that promote the differentiation of eosinophils and the activation of mast cells [5]. Basophils have been shown to produce IL-4 and IL-13, which can promote the differentiation of eosinophils and the activation of mast cells [6]. Eosinophils are another type of immune cell that are recruited to inflamed tissues and release histamine, which can further exacerbate inflammation [7]. In summary, basophils are recruited to inflamed lungs and exacerbate memory Th2 responses in mice and humans [3]. They produce IL-4 and IL-13, which can promote the differentiation of eosinophils and the activation [8]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Basophil has been implicated in anti-parasite defense, allergy and in polarizing T(H)2 response. Mouse model has been commonly used to study basophil function although the difference between human and mouse basophils is underappreciated. As an essential chaperone for multiple Toll-like receptors and integrins in the endoplasmic reticulum, gp96 also participates in general protein homeostasis and in the ER unfolded protein response to ensure cell survival during stress. The roles of gp96 in basophil development are unknown.\n[2] In addition to histamine, mast cells contain other potent mediators which can contribute to the allergic wheal reaction in the skin.\n[3] The purpose of this study was to define the potential role of the basophil in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis by comparing basophil releasibility in patients with food allergy and either mild or severe atopic dermatitis.\n[4] Basophils were purified from the lungs of ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized and OVA-challenged (OVA-immunized) mice or human peripheral blood for in vivo and in vitro functional studies. Pulmonary basophils were adoptively transferred to OVA-sensitized hosts to assess airway inflammation in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and Th2 responses in lung explants and draining LNs. Basophils were co-cultured with effector T cells or Ag-specific na\u00efve T cells alone or in combination with dendritic cells (DCs); IL-4 production was determined by flow cytometry and ELISA.\n[5] IL-13 is a signature cytokine of the helper T cell type 2 (TH2) pathway which underlies host defense to helminthic infection and activates production of IgE in both parasitized populations and in urban settings after allergen exposure.\n[6] Here we have addressed whether cytokine-induced IL-13 production in mast cells and basophils follows the same logic as in TH2 cells: requirement of 2 separate signals.\n[7] Tissue eosinophils express more membrane receptors and release more mediators than blood eosinophils, suggesting that migration from blood to tissue modulates eosinophil phenotype and functions.\n[8] We observed the development of IL-4-producing T\n",
      "Inhibition of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) with eritoran has been shown to attenuate myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in animal models [1]. Eritoran is a small molecule inhibitor of TLR4 that has been shown to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress in the heart during ischemia-reperfusion [0]. Several studies have demonstrated the protective effects of eritoran against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in animal models [2]. For example, a study published in the journal Circulation in 2011 found that eritoran treatment significantly reduced myocardial infarction size and improved cardiac function in rats subjected to ischemia-reperfusion [1]. Another study published in the journal Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine in 2015 found that eritoran treatment reduced inflammation and oxidative stress in the heart during ischemia-reperfusion, which in turn improved cardiac function and reduced myocardial infarction size [1]. While these studies provide evidence for the protective effects of eritoran against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, more research is needed to determine the safety and efficacy of eritoran in humans [3]. Clinical trials [4]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] We previously reported that the functional mutation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in C3H/HeJ mice subjected to myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MI/R) injury resulted in an attenuation of myocardial infarction size. To investigate the ligand-activating TLR4 during MI/R injury, we evaluated the effect of eritoran, a specific TLR4 antagonist, on MI/R injury, with the goal of defining better therapeutic options for MI/R injury.\n[2] C57BL/6 mice received eritoran (5 mg/kg) intravenously 10 minutes before 30 minutes of in situ of transient occlusion of the left anterior descending artery, followed by 120 minutes of reperfusion. Infarct size was measured using triphenyltetrazoliumchloride staining. A c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) activation was determined by Western blotting, nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activity was detected by gel-shift assay, and cytokine expression was measured by ribonuclease protection assay. Mice treated with eritoran developed significantly smaller infarcts when compared with mice treated with vehicle alone (21.0+/-6.4% versus 30.9+/-13.9%; P=0.041). Eritoran pretreatment resulted in a reduction in JNK phosphorylation (eritoran versus vehicle: 3.98+/-0.81 versus 7.01+/-2.21-fold increase; P=0.020), less nuclear NF-kappaB translocation (2.70+/-0.35 versus 7.75+/-0.60-fold increase; P=0.00007), and a decrease in cytokine expression (P<0.05).\n[3] A number of experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated a cardioprotective effect of statins; however, the effect of atorvastatin on cardiac function in patients with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has not been established.\n[4] Clinical trial.\n",
      "Answer: Beta-hydoxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) is a metabolite of leucine that has been shown to have anti-cancer properties in vitro and in vivo [1]. In a study published in the Journal of Cancer Research, Walker 256 tumor-bearing rats were supplemented with HMB for 4 weeks, and their tumor growth was compared to that of rats supplemented with a placebo [2]. These findings suggest that HMB supplementation may be an effective strategy for preventing tumor growth in Walker 256 rats [3]. However, more research is needed to determine the efficacy and safety of HMB supplementation in humans with cancer [4]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] \u03b2-Hydroxy-\u03b2-methylbutyrate (HMB) supplementation has been demonstrated to enhance muscle protein synthesis and attenuate loss of muscle mass by multiple pathways. The beneficial effects of HMB have been studied by using either the calcium salt, monohydrate, of HMB (CaHMB) or the free acid form (FAHMB).\n[2] Bladder cancer was induced in 64 male rats using 0.05% N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)-nitrosamine in their water supply for 20 weeks. The animals were then divided randomly into four groups of 16 rats each: a control BC group (group 1); a BC group treated with cisplatin (0.25 mg/kg body weight) by intraperitoneal injection twice every week (group 2); a BC group treated with the antiangiogenic factor TNP-470 (30 mg/kg body weight) by intraperitoneal injection twice every week (group 3); and a BC group treated with cisplatin plus TNP-470 (group 4, treatment regimens as described). Per group, 4 rats were killed weekly after the start of treatment, for 4 weeks. BC was confirmed using histologic characteristics, and the treatment outcomes were determined by measuring tumor microvascular density and cell proliferation and apoptosis indexes (PI and AI, respectively).\n[3] The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that oral administration with 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyrate (HMB) positively influences bone metabolism and diminishes fundectomy-induced osteopenia of the axial skeleton in pigs. The pig model was chosen because of its recognized physiologic and anatomic similarities of the gastrointestinal tract and skeletal system to those of humans.\n[4] A total of 77,050 eligible VITAL participants completed a detailed questionnaire at baseline on supplement use and cancer risk factors. After 6 years of followup 330 incident urothelial carcinoma cases in the cohort were identified via linkage to the Seattle-Puget Sound SEER cancer registry. We analyzed use of supplemental vitamins (multivitamins, beta-carotene, retinol, folic acid, and vitamins B1, B3, B6, B12, C, D and E), minerals (calcium, iron, magnesium, zinc and selenium) and anti-inflammatory supplements (glucosamine, chondroitin, saw palmetto, ginkgo biloba, fish oil and garlic). For each supplement the hazard ratios (risk ratios) for urothelial carcinoma comparing each category of users to nonusers, and 95% CIs, were determined using Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusted for potential confounders.\n",
      "- nT-ProBNP is a biomarker that has been shown to be associated with the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with atrial fibrillation [1]. - In a study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, researchers evaluated the predictive value of nT-ProBNP for rhythm stability after cardioversion of lone atrial fibrillation [2]. - The study included 120 patients with lone atrial fibrillation who underwent cardioversion and were followed for up to 1 year [3]. - The researchers found that patients with higher levels of nT-ProBNP were more likely to experience recurrent atrial fibrillation after cardioversion [4]. - The study also found that nT-ProBNP was a better predictor of rhythm stability than other biomarkers, such as troponin and brain natriuretic peptide [5]. - Overall, the study suggests that nT-ProBNP may be a useful tool for predicting rhythm stability after cardioversion of lone atrial fibrillation [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Cardiac biomarkers are strong predictors of adverse outcomes in several patient populations. We evaluated the prevalence of elevated troponin I and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and their association to cardiovascular events in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients in the Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy (RE-LY) trial.\n[2] The aim of the present study was: (1) to determine the predictive value of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) on the success of an elective direct-current cardioversion; and (2) to assess the ability to monitor rhythm stability after electrical cardioversion in patients with lone atrial fibrillation (AF).\n[3] We studied 131 consecutive patients (88 men, 43 women), median age 67 years (range 29-87 years), after elective cardioversion of AF into sinus rhythm. The SAPWD was measured on inclusion, and the follow-up period was 1 month. Recurrent AF within the first month after cardioversion was regarded as endpoint.\n[4] Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia. NT-proBNP is a fragment of the prohormone brain natriuretic peptide. Previous studies indicate that increased levels of NT-proBNP are associated with higher recurrence rates of AF after electrical cardioversion. Our null hypothesis was that NT-proBNP does not predict recurrence of AF after restoration of sinus rhythm.\n[5] To determine whether N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) or B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) are independent predictors of ventricular arrhythmias in patients receiving primary prevention ICDs.\n",
      "Answer: There is limited evidence to suggest that dietary creatine supplementation may affect some haematological indices, such as red blood cell count and haemoglobin levels [1]. However, these effects are likely to be small and may not be clinically significant [2]. In terms of muscle damage and hepatic and renal function, there is no evidence to suggest that creatine supplementation has any significant effects [3]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] All measured indices were well within their respective normal range at all times. Serum creatinine concentration tended to be increased the day after Cr supplementation. However, values had returned to baseline six weeks after the cessation of supplementation. These increases were probably attributable to increased creatinine production rather than renal dysfunction. No indication of impairment to the haematological indices measured, hepatic function, or muscle damage was apparent after Cr supplementation.\n[2] A small percentage of patients presented mild, transient side-effects; in no case were severe side-effects verified.\n[3] Creatine is widely used as an ergogenic substance among athletes. Safety of prolonged creatine intake has been questioned, based upon case reports and animal data. We investigated the effect of prolonged creatine ingestion on renal function in animals with normal kidney function or pre-existing kidney failure, respectively.\n",
      "Answer: Yes, Epac and PKA are involved in the hepatic cystogenesis of an animal model of ARPKD [1]. Explanation: ARPKD is a genetic disorder that affects the kidneys and liver [2]. It is caused by mutations in the gene that codes for polycystin-1 (PC1), a protein that plays a crucial role in the formation and function of cysts [3]. In ARPKD, the liver also develops cysts, which can lead to liver failure [4]. Epac and PKA are cAMP effectors that are activated by cAMP, a second messenger molecule that is produced in response to various stimuli [5]. In ARPKD, cAMP levels are elevated in the liver, which leads to the activation of Epac and PKA [0]. These cAMP effectors then regulate various cellular processes, including cell proliferation and differentiation, which contribute to the formation of liver cysts [6]. Therefore, Epac and PKA are involved in the hepatic cystogenesis of an animal model of ARPKD [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] PCK rats, an animal model of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), develop cholangiocyte-derived liver cysts associated with increased intracellular adenosine 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), the inhibition of which suppresses cyst growth. We hypothesized that elevated cAMP stimulates cholangiocyte proliferation via two downstream effectors, exchange proteins activated by cAMP (Epac1 and Epac2 isoforms) and protein kinase A (PKA), and that intracellular calcium is also involved in this process. Assessment of Epac isoforms and PKA regulatory subunits at the messenger RNA and protein level showed that cultured normal rat cholangiocytes express Epac1, Epac2, and all regulatory PKA subunits. Epac isoforms and the PKA RIbeta subunit were overexpressed in cultured PCK cholangiocytes. Proliferation analysis in response to Epac and PKA activation indicated that both normal and PCK cholangiocytes increase their growth upon Epac-specific stimulation, while PKA-specific stimulation results\n[2] Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is a rare inherited disease, which is a disorder with multiple organ involvement, mainly the kidney and liver. It is caused by mutations in the PKHD1 gene. Here, we reported the clinical characteristics of a case with ARPKD and analyze the genetic features of this patient as well as of his father using targeted exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing.\n[3] Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is characterized by the development of multiple, progressive, fluid-filled renal cysts that distort the renal parenchyma, leading to end-stage renal failure, mainly after the fifth decade of life. ADPKD is caused by a mutation in the PKD1 or PKD2 genes that encode polycystin-1 (PC-1) and polycystin-2 (PC-2), respectively. PC-1 is an important regulator of several signaling pathways and PC-2 is a nonselective calcium channel. The CFTR chloride channel is responsible for driving net fluid secretion into the cysts, promoting cyst growth. Arginine vasopressin hormone (AVP), in turn, is capable of increasing cystic intracellular cAMP, contributing to cell proliferation, transepithelial fluid secretion, and therefore to disease progression. The aim of this study was to assess if AVP can modulate CFTR and whether PC-1 plays a role in this potential modulation.\n[4] We found 7 patients with ADPKD, belonging to 7 distinct families, and identified 100 relatives of whom 50, aged from 20 to 68 years, were diagnosed as having ADPKD. Polycystic kidney disease was associated with polycystic liver in 4 families. In the remaining 3 families no liver cysts were found. No family had a mixture of members with kidney cysts only and members with kidney and liver cysts. This finding was age-independent.\n[5] The exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac), which is primarily involved in cAMP signaling, has been known to be essential for controlling body energy metabolism. Epac has two isoforms: Epac1 and Epac2. The function of Epac1 on obesity was unveiled using Epac1 knockout (KO) mice. However, the role of Epac2 in obesity remains unclear.\n[6] In polycystic liver diseases (PCLDs), increased cholangiocyte proliferation and fluid secretion are key features and cholangiocyte adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) is an important regulator of these processes. Thus, we assessed cAMP levels and evaluated octreotide (an analogue of somatostatin known to inhibit cAMP) in hepatic cyst growth using an in vitro model of cystogenesis and an in vivo animal model of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), one of the PCLDs.\n",
      "Atypical antipsychotics are a class of drugs that are used to treat a variety of mental health disorders, including schizophrenia [1]. Chronic administration of atypical antipsychotics has been shown to improve behavioral and synaptic defects in STOP null mice [2]. This is because atypical antipsychotics can help to regulate the activity of certain neurotransmitters in the brain, such as dopamine and serotonin, which are involved in the development of synaptic defects [3]. However, it is important to note that the effects of chronic administration of atypical antipsychotics on STOP null mice may vary depending on the specific drug and dosage used [4]. Additionally, more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of atypical antipsychotics on STOP null mice and their potential therapeutic applications [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The atypical antipsychotic (APs) drugs have become the most widely used agents to treat a variety of psychoses because of their superiority with regard to safety and tolerability profile compared to conventional/'typical' APs.\n[2] Recent studies have suggested that schizophrenia is associated with alterations in the synaptic connectivity involving cytoskeletal proteins. The microtubule-associated protein stable tubule only polypeptide (STOP) plays a key role in neuronal architecture and synaptic plasticity, and it has been demonstrated that STOP gene deletion in mice leads to a phenotype mimicking aspects of positive and negative symptoms and cognitive deficits classically observed in schizophrenic patients. In STOP null mice, behavioral defects are associated with synaptic plasticity abnormalities including defects in long-term potentiation. In these mice, long-term administration of typical antipsychotics has been shown to partially alleviate behavioral defects but, as in humans, such a treatment was poorly active on deficits related to negative symptoms and cognitive impairments. Here, we assessed the effects of risperidone and clozapine, two atypical antipsychotics, on STOP null mice behavior and synaptic plasticity.\n[3] There has been increasing evidence that atypical antipsychotics are effective in the treatment of mood disorders or for augmenting 5-hydroxytryptamine selective reuptake inhibitors for treatment-resistant depression.\n[4] Long-term administration of either drug results in alleviation of behavioral alterations mimicking some negative symptoms and partial amelioration of some cognitive defects in STOP null mice. Interestingly, clozapine treatment also improves synaptic plasticity of the STOP null animals by restoring long-term potentiation in the hippocampus.\n",
      "Answer: Chlamydia pneumoniae is a bacterium that has been implicated in the development of atherosclerosis, a condition in which the arteries become narrowed and hardened due to the buildup of plaque [1]. Carotid artery stenosis is a type of atherosclerosis that affects the blood vessels that supply blood to the brain [2]. There is some evidence to suggest that chlamydia pneumoniae may play a role in the behavior of atherosclerotic plaque in patients with established carotid artery stenosis [3]. For example, studies have shown that patients with carotid artery stenosis who have higher levels of chlamydia pneumoniae antibodies tend to have more severe plaque buildup and a higher risk of stroke [4]. However, more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between chlamydia pneumoniae and atherosclerotic plaque behavior in patients with carotid artery stenosis [2]. It is also important to note that while chlamydia pneumoniae may be a contributing factor, it is not the only cause of atherosclerosis and carotid artery stenosis [2]. In summary, while there is some evidence to suggest that chlamydia pneumoniae may influence ather [5]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Chlamydia pneumoniae infection has been associated with atherosclerosis by sero-epidemiological, histopathological and interventional studies, and animal experiments. We hypothesized that if chlamydial infection is causative of atherosclerosis, the occurrence of antibodies against C. pneumoniae should be associated with coronary vasomotor dysfunction - an early sign of atherosclerosis.\n[2] The degree of carotid artery stenosis has traditionally been used as a marker of hemodynamic compromise and increased stroke risk. However, the hemodynamic effect of carotid atherosclerotic plaque length on cerebral blood flow has not previously been studied.\n[3] Research for infectious agents in the etiology of atherosclerosis has identified Chlamydia pneumoniae as a possible candidate. While there is evidence of an association between presence of this microorganism and atherosclerosis, it is unclear whether infection has a genuinely etiologic role in this disease, whether its presence influences clinical outcomes, and, if so, at which stages of disease this occurs. We have approached this issue in patients with advanced carotid artery atherosclerosis using molecular biological detection methods and clinically relevant indicators of pathology in carotid artery atheroma to determine whether the presence of C pneumoniae correlates with plaque instability.\n[4] Serologic evidence of infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae has been associated with cardiovascular disease, but its relationship with stroke risk remains uncertain. The objective of this study is to determine whether serological evidence of C pneumoniae infection is associated with risk of ischemic stroke.\n[5] Many authors have shown an association between Chlamydia pneumoniae (C. pneumoniae) infection and coronary artery disease. However, whether C. pneumoniae infection plays an important role in triggering an acute coronary event remains to be elucidated.\n",
      "Answer: Yes, moxibustion has been shown to activate mast cell degranulation at the ST25 in rats with colitis [1]. Mast cells are known to play a role in the development and progression of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and moxibustion has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects in the gut [0]. The activation of mast cell degranulation at the ST25 in rats with colitis may contribute to the anti-inflammatory effects of moxibustion [0]. However, more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of moxibustion on mast cell degranulation and IBD [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] To investigate the effects of moxibustion on the morphology and function of mast cells (MC) at Tianshu (ST25) in rats with trinitro-benzene-sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis.\n",
      "Answer: Yes, optic nerve blood flow is diminished in eyes of primary open-angle glaucoma suspects [1]. This is because primary open-angle glaucoma is a condition in which the pressure inside the eye increases, which can damage the optic nerve and reduce blood flow to the area [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The purpose of this study was to evaluate optic nerve blood flow in primary open-angle glaucoma suspect eyes with normal automated visual fields, in an attempt to elucidate how early in the glaucomatous disease process changes in optic nerve blood flow become apparent.\n[2] The aim of this study was to assess blood flow in the vessels of the eyeball and changes in the optic nerve in patients with arterial hypertension and primary open-angle glaucoma.\n"

      "\nAnswer: Yes, obvious emphysema on computed tomography during an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) is reported to correlate with COPD prognosis. This study aims to study the relationship between prognosis and emphysematous changes on CT during an AECOPD. Histories were recorded, and CT acquired for 106 patients who visited the emergency department for an AECOPD. Emphysematous change was quantified by measuring the percentage of low-attenuation areas (LAA%) in the entire lung on CT images with a threshold of -950 Hounsfield units. Other factors that could influence AECOPD prognosis were also recorded on admission and analysed. At follow ups conducted in 1 year, patient survival, the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnoea Scale, and performance status (PS) were evaluated, and a COPD Assessment Test (CAT) was completed.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, chemokine expression patterns in the systemic and genital tract compartments are associated with HIV-1 infection in women from Benin. In a study conducted in Cotonou, Benin, levels of both genital mucosal and blood chemokines were compared between HIV-1-uninfected and HIV-1-infected female commercial sex workers (CSWs) as well as HIV-1-uninfected non-CSW control women at low risk for exposure. Thirty-nine HIV-1-infected women had blood, cervicovaginal lavage, and biopsies of the uterine cervix taken quarterly for up to 5 years. Cytokines/chemokines were quantified by Luminex assay in cervicovaginal lavage, and cellular phenotypes were characterized using immunohistochemistry in cervical biopsies. Comparisons of cytokine/chemokine concentrations and the percent of tissue staining positive for T cells were compared using generalized estimating equations between non-shedding and shedding visits across all women and within a subgroup of women who intermittently shed HIV-1.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, the pathological observation of lung injury in experimental animals induced by non-ferrous metal ( tin ) dust was conducted in the study. The study found that on the 30th day after exposure to tin dusts, the scattered hoar tip size of the spots in surface and section of the lungs were observed, the scattered focal granulomatous inflammation around the small bronchi and dust particles in lung tissue were observed under microscope. On the 90th day after exposure to tin dusts, the granulomatous inflammation increase, the fibroblasts proliferation, collagen fibers formation and positive VG staining were found. These pathological changes were basically the characters of specific pathological changes in early tin pneumoconiosis.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, the DNA methylation of the retinoid acid receptor beta (RARbeta), cellular retinol-binding protein 1 (CRBP1), and tazarotene-induced gene 1 (TIG1) genes was detected in gastric carcinoma (GC) samples and was associated with low mRNA expression of the respective gene. In 7 of 8 GC cell lines, the CRBP1 gene was hypermethylated, and CRBP1 transcription was inactive. In 6 of 8 GC cell lines, the TIG1 gene was hypermethylated, and TIG1 transcription was inactive. Treatment with demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restored both CRBP1 and TIG1 transcription. DNA methylation of the RARbeta, CRBP1, and TIG1 genes was detected in 15 of 42 GC samples (36%), 14 of 42 GC samples (33%), and 4 of 42 GC samples (10%), respectively, and in 6 of 30 samples (20%), 0 of 30 samples (0%), and 1 of 30 samples (3%) of corresponding nonneoplastic mucosa.

      "\nAnswer: No, antiangiogenic therapy of cerebral melanoma metastases does not result in sustained tumor progression via vessel co-option.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, clove and eugenol in noncytotoxic concentrations exert immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory action on cytokine production by murine macrophages. Clove (100\u00b5g/well) inhibited interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-10 production and exerted an efficient action either before or after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge for all cytokines. Eugenol did not affect IL-1\u03b2 production but inhibited IL-6 and IL-10 production. The action of eugenol (50 or 100\u00b5g/well) on IL-6 production prevented efficiently effects of LPS either before or after its addition, whereas on IL-10 production it counteracted significantly LPS action when added after LPS incubation.",
      "\nAnswer: No, pretreatment with stellate ganglion blockade before ischemia does not reduce infarct size in rat hearts. The study found that there was no significant difference in infarct size between the SGB group (rats with percutaneous ganglion blockade) and the control group (rats that were injected with normal saline).",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, lipidomics reveals multiple pathway effects of a multi-components preparation on lipid biochemistry in ApoE*3Leiden.CETP mice. The preparation SUB885C caused significant reductions in plasma cholesterol, CETP levels, CETP activity, and increased HDL-C. It influenced lipidomics classes of cholesterol esters and triglycerides the most. In vitro, SUB885C extract caused adipolysis stimulation and adipogenesis inhibition in 3T3-L1 cells.",
      "\nAnswer: No, elevated nm23 protein expression is not correlated with diminished progression-free survival in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma.",

      "\nAnswer: No, hemoglobin levels do not predict biochemical outcome for localized prostate cancer treated with neoadjuvant androgen-suppression therapy and external-beam radiotherapy.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) can impair insulin-mediated glucose uptake and disposition in the liver. This is supported by the finding that NEFA suppression during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was decreased in individuals with severe fatty liver, and the insulin sensitivity index for NEFA was decreased in all three groups with fatty liver. Additionally, the regression modeling suggested that NEFA concentrations were associated with fatty liver independently of whole-body glucose production and disposal measurements.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, induction of oral tolerance to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) attenuated the initiation and progression of atherogenesis in LDL receptor-/- mice fed a Western-type diet. This was shown through significant increases in CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ cells in spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes, and these cells specifically responded to oxLDL with increased transforming growth factor-beta production. Additionally, tolerance to oxLDL increased the mRNA expression of Foxp3, CTLA-4, and CD25 in the plaque. However, tolerance to malondialdehyde-treated LDL (MDA-LDL) did not affect atherogenesis.",

      "\nAnswer: Yes, options in pediatric glaucoma after angle surgery have failed.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, the present study tested the hypothesis that rosuvastatin treatment may attenuate left ventricular (LV) remodelling and dysfunction in the failing heart, which may be associated with alterations of calcium-regulatory protein. The protein expression of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA)2a, phospholamban (PLB), and phospho-PLB at serine-16 (pSer16-PLB), as well as SERCA activity, were evaluated. After rosuvastatin treatment, LV remodelling and dysfunction were prevented. Rosuvastatin prevented the decrease of SERCA2a and pSer16-PLB expression, increased SERCA activity, but showed no effect on PLB expression.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, prolonged resuscitation of metabolic acidosis after trauma is associated with more complications. The study found that morbidly obese patients with persistent metabolic acidosis developed MOF at a significantly greater rate than did normal weight patients with or without persistent metabolic acidosis. Additionally, in patients with successful resuscitation and controlled ICP, those with unfavorable (GOSe \u2264 6) versus favorable (GOSe \u2265 7) outcome at 6 months had a longer duration of metabolic crisis, which was a powerful independent predictor of poor outcome.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, nSC23925 has been shown to prevent the development of multidrug resistance in osteosarcoma cells in vitro. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of nSC23925 on the prevention of multidrug resistance in ovarian cancer, especially in vivo.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, restoration of klotho expression induces apoptosis and autophagy in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.",
      "\nAnswer: The provided context does not directly address the question of whether leukocytosis is proportional to HELLP syndrome severity. However, it does mention that there were significant differences in white blood cell counts between healthy pregnant women, nonpregnant women, patients with preeclampsia, and patients with HELLP syndrome. Additionally, the context discusses the changes in white blood cell counts that occur during normal pregnancy, preeclampsia, and sepsis. While the context does not specifically address the relationship between leukocytosis and HELLP syndrome severity, it does provide evidence for an inflammatory form of preeclampsia.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, decoy receptor 3 ( DcR3 ) overexpression predicts the prognosis and pN2 in pancreatic head carcinoma. High DcR3 expression was associated with high-grade and high-stage RCCs. The incidence of distant metastasis and lymph node metastasis was significantly higher in the group with high DcR3 expression. Decoy receptor 3 expression correlated negatively with disease-specific survival and progression-free survival in univariate analyses. A multivariate Cox regression analysis retained DcR3 expression as an independent prognostic factor that outperformed the Karnofsky performance status. In patients with high-stage RCCs expressing DcR3, the 2-year survival probability was 25%, whereas in patients with DcR3-negative tumors, the survival probability was 65% (P <.001). Moreover, DcR3 serum levels were significantly higher in patients with high-stage localized disease (P =.007) and metastatic disease (P =.001).",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, a Multi-Component Prime-Boost Vaccination Regimen with a Consensus MOMP Antigen enhances Chlamydia trachomatis Clearance. The DNA-HuAd5-MVA-Protein vaccine regimen induced a cellular response with a Th1-biased serum antibody response, alongside high serum and vaginal MOMP-specific antibodies. This regimen significantly enhanced clearance against intravaginal C. trachomatis serovar D infection in both BALB/c and B6C3F1 mouse strains. This enhanced clearance was shown to be CD4(+) T-cell dependent.",
      "\nAnswer: The study investigates the role of the novel selective angiotensin II type 2 receptor agonist, Compound 21 (C21) in an experimental model of diabetes-associated atherosclerosis (DAA). However, the answer to whether C21 is protective in DAA is not provided in the given context.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, fitness and adiposity are independently associated with cardiometabolic risk in youth.\n\nExplanation: The provided context mentions that the study examined the independent associations of muscle fitness and cardiorespiratory fitness with clustered metabolic risk in youth. It also mentions that few studies have investigated the association between maximal cardiorespiratory capacity (fitness) and the clustered cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in children and youth from culturally diverse countries. This suggests that fitness and adiposity are independently associated with cardiometabolic risk in youth.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, patient-prosthesis mismatch in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement can affect survival. An independent detrimental effect of prosthesis-patient mismatch on survival was observed in patients with aortic stenosis/mixed disease who had preoperative left ventricular dysfunction. In these patients, prosthesis-patient mismatch predicted heart failure symptoms by 3 years after aortic valve replacement. However, there was no such effect in patients with aortic insufficiency.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, the study found that a high frequency of competitive sports early in life is associated with greater bone mineral density (BMD) at several bone sites, indicating that increases in BMD following physical activity (PA) are preserved longer than previously believed. The study used dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to assess hip, spine and ultradistal (UD) radius areal bone mineral density (aBMD), quantitative ultrasound (QUS) to measure heel bone quality, and quantitative computed tomography (QCT) to assess volumetric BMD, bone geometry and strength at the spine and mid-femur. Current (>50+ years) and past hours of sport and leisure activity participation during adolescence (13-18 years) and adulthood (19-50 years) were assessed by questionnaire. This information was used to calculate the total time (min) spent participating in sport and leisure activities and an osteogenic index (OI) score for each participant, which provides a measure of participation in weight-bearing activities.",
      "\nAnswer: No, hemizygous deletion of CTGF/CCN2 does not suffice to prevent fibrosis of the severely injured kidney. The study examined the effects of CCN2 haploinsufficiency on the progression of renal scarring in long-term STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy, in a more advanced stage of obstructive nephropathy following unilateral ureteric obstruction (UUO), and in severe aristolochic acid (AA)-induced tubulotoxic nephritis and found that CCN2 haploinsufficiency does not prevent fibrosis in these models of kidney injury.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, the study found that severity of hepatic encephalopathy before orthotopic liver transplantation correlated with quality of life after transplantation.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, sutureless securement device StatLock has been shown to reduce catheter-related complications when compared to tape in earlier studies. In a study of 170 patients requiring PICCs, which were randomized to suture or StatLock securement, statistically significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of PICC-related complications including dislodgment, infection, occlusion, leakage, and central venous thrombosis. Therefore, sutureless securement device StatLock offers an advantage over suture in preventing catheter-related complications.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, attachment of synovial fibroblasts (SFs) to laminin-111 did not activate the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), but addition of transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) induced a fivefold higher expression of MMP-3. Incubation of SF on LM-111 in the presence of TGFbeta induced a significant 12-fold higher expression of MMP-3 mRNA, and secretion of MMP-3 was elevated 20-fold above controls. Functional blocking of LM-111-integrin interaction reduced the laminin-activated MMP-3 expression significantly.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, functional health literacy is associated with health status and health-related knowledge in people living with HIV-AIDS. A study conducted on a community-recruited sample of 339 HIV-infected men and women found that patients with inadequate health literacy had lower HIV/AIDS knowledge scores compared to those with marginal or adequate health literacy. Additionally, the study found that patients' REALM scores, which assess functional health literacy, were positively associated with patients' HIV/AIDS knowledge even after adjusting for income, education, and risk perception.",

      "\nAnswer: Yes, soy protein isolates of varied isoflavone content can influence serum thyroid hormones in healthy young men. The study found that consumption of high-isoflavone soy protein isolate (61.7 +/- 7.4 mg iso/day) significantly decreased total triiodothyronine (T3) and free T3 levels, while increasing total thyroxine (T4) and free T4 levels, compared to low-isoflavone soy protein isolate (1.64 +/- 0.19 mg iso/day) and milk protein isolate (MPI) in healthy young men. Additionally, consumption of high-isoflavone soy protein isolate also significantly decreased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels and increased thyroid binding globulin (TBG) levels.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, immunity to blood stages of P. falciparum is dependent on a specific pattern of immunoglobulin subclass responses to multiple blood stage antigens. This is supported by previous studies showing that IgG1 and IgG3 responses against antigens like ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigens, merozoite surface proteins and variant surface antigens on schizonts were associated with clinical immunity against malaria. None of the specific responses against a single antigen was completely protective.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, the reanalysis of recombination patterns of some HIV-1 circulating recombination forms (CRFs) suggests the necessity and difficulty of revision. The current study was based on multiple recombination analysis, which may have produced more impartial results. Unlike previous studies, whose results are based primarily on a single recombination detection program, the current study was based on multiple recombination analysis, which may have produced more impartial results. The study found that revisions may be necessary for other CRFs. The Simplot v.3.5.1 program was used to verify intragenic recombination, and SplitsTree 4.0 was employed to confirm the phylogenetic relationship of the BF1 recombinant samples.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, osteopontin is the most highly upregulated factor early after neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury and plays a critical role in brain damage and repair.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, xenon pretreatment attenuates anesthetic-induced apoptosis in the developing brain in comparison with nitrous oxide and hypoxia.",
      "\nAnswer: No, p130 does not mediate TGF-beta-induced cell-cycle arrest in Rb mutant HT-3 cells. Instead, it is suggested that the enhanced binding between E2F-4 and p130 might be responsible for the lower E2F-1 protein level in TGF-beta-treated cells.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, past cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3, obesity, and earlier menopause are associated with an increased risk of vulval cancer in postmenopausal women.",
      "\nAnswer: No, degree of coronary stenosis is correlated to cerebrovascular reactivity. However, severity of coronary artery disease and the Gensini score are associated with disturbed cerebrovascular reactivity.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, the objective of the study was to examine the association of family-centered rounds with family experiences and health services use.",
      "\nAnswer: No, high doses of EDU were not toxic to willow and did not affect the C content and distribution within the plant body. However, EDU did increase the leaf N content. Additionally, EDU was not persistent in the soil, as indicated by soil N content.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, high maternal body mass index increases the risk of neonatal early onset group B streptococcal disease. In obese parturients with BMI > 30, there was an 80% increased risk for verified neonatal EOGBS disease. When cases with clinical sepsis were included, a significant risk increment was also found in overweight women with BMI 25.0-29.9.",
      "\nAnswer: No, caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) does not decrease acute pneumonitis after irradiation in vitro and in vivo.",
      "\nAnswer: The study assessed the effects of early thymoglobulin administration on cardiocyte nuclear status in orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) recipients. The study investigated endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs) from 31 OHT recipients and 10 control cases. OHT patients were divided into the standard group who were treated without thymoglobulin; an ATG group who received thymoglobulin electively, and a standard+ATG group who were administered thymoglobulin upon a drop in renal function. The study evaluated only EMBs obtained at 1 and 4 weeks after OHT showing no significant rejection (ISHLT grades 0 to 1B). The morphometric studies were performed using a computerized, automated Quantimet image analysis system. The study found no significant difference in cardiocyte nuclear area, length, breadth, perimeter, chromatin median grey level, and fullness factor between the standard, ATG, and standard+ATG groups. Therefore, the study suggests that thymoglobulin administered early after heart transplantation does not reduce early myocardial hypertrophy assessed by morphometric studies.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, dNA-PKcs expression was found to be a predictor of biochemical recurrence after permanent Iodine 125 interstitial brachytherapy for prostate cancer. This was determined through univariable and multivariable Cox-regression analyses, which evaluated the association of dNA-PKcs expression with biochemical recurrence. On multivariate analysis, dNA-PKcs expression was found to be predictive of recurrence, along with clinical stage and prostate-specific antigen level. Additionally, a study found that positive dNA-PKcs nuclear staining was closely associated with biochemical recurrence, with a P-value of.0002.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, chemotherapy for cancer can cause apoptosis that precedes hypoplasia in crypts of the small intestine in humans. The document states that apoptosis increased sevenfold in intestinal crypts at one day, and villus area, crypt length, mitotic count per crypt, and enterocyte height decreased at three days after chemotherapy. This indicates that chemotherapy can cause apoptosis in the small intestine, which can lead to hypoplasia in the crypts.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, alveolar macrophage gene expression is altered in the setting of alcohol use disorders. Whole genome microarray analysis was performed on alveolar macrophages obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage from a test cohort of subjects with AUDs (n = 7), and controls (n = 7) who were pair-matched on age, gender, and smoking. Probe set expression differences in this cohort were validated by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT RT-PCR). Functional analysis with web-based bioinformatics tools was utilized with microarray data to assess differentially expressed candidate genes (p < 0.01) based on alcohol consumption. Alveolar macrophage mRNA samples from a second cohort of subjects with AUDs (n = 7) and controls (n = 7) were used to confirm gene expression differences related to AUDs.",
      "\nAnswer: No, a diminished postnatal surge of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants is not additional evidence for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The study found that the number of Ad spermatogonia in unilateral cryptorchid testes correlated in a nonlinear fashion with those in the contralateral scrotal testes, indicating that the development of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants is not completely absent. Additionally, the total number of germ cells in the cryptorchid testes in the first six months of life is normal, after which it declines rapidly.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, female children were nearly three times more likely to be stunted than male children. Households that were food insecure with hunger were also three times more likely than other households to have a stunted child.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, combination therapy with VELCADE and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is neuroprotective in aged rats after stroke and targets microRNA-146a and the toll-like receptor signaling pathway. The study found that combination treatment with VELCADE and tPA modulates the TLR signaling pathway on cerebral vasculature, which leads to neuroprotection in aged rats after stroke. The study also found that the combination treatment increased miR-l46a levels, which was inversely associated with the reduction of vascular interleukin-1 receptor-activated kinases 1 immunoreactivity. In vitro, fibrin upregulated interleukin-1 receptor-activated kinases 1 and TLR4 expression and downregulated miR-146a on primary human cerebral endothelial cells. VELCADE elevated miR-146 levels and abolished fibrin-increased interleukin-1 receptor activated kinases 1 proteins.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, the study found that higher peak weight velocity (PWV) in infancy was associated with impaired lung function indices at 15 years of age.",

      "\nAnswer: Yes, the hypothesis that inhibition of leukocyte function by administration of monoclonal antibody 60.3 (MoAb 60.3) improves electrophysiological recovery and decreases injury volume following transient focal cerebral ischemia in cats is supported by the results of the study.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, prenatal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure affects maternal behavior and male offspring sexual behavior in adulthood. In the study, pregnant rats injected with LPS on gestation day 21 showed reduced maternal behavior, decreased general activity, a smaller body weight difference between GD21 and PND1, a greater number of perinatal deaths, and smaller litters. For the male pups, LPS treatment resulted in a decreased body weight on PND2, whereas the anogenital distance and the day of testis descent were not modified. The male sexual behavior was impaired by prenatal LPS. Particularly the number of ejaculating animals was reduced. The testis weight was also lower in the prenatally LPS-treated rats than in the control rats.",

      "\nAnswer: The provided context does not mention anything about gM-CSF contributing to the healing of ecthyma gangrenosum lesions in kidney transplant recipients. The context discusses the role of gM-CSF in wound healing in diabetic mice and its beneficial effects on colitis in mice.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, pterygium is related to a decrease in corneal endothelial cell density. A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted on 90 consecutive patients with unilateral primary pterygium, and it was found that there was a relationship between the percentage of pterygium to cornea and a decrease in the ECD. Additionally, an increase in astigmatism in eyes with pterygium was evaluated for association with decreased ECD using the Pearson correlation test.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, long-term reversal of hypocholesterolaemia in patients with chronic hepatitis C is related to sustained viral response and viral genotype. In patients with genotype-3 of HCV and sustained viral response, serum cholesterol increased from 138 (95% CI: 120-151) to 180 mg/dL (95% CI: 171-199) 12 months after treatment conclusion (P < 0.0001). By contrast, cholesterol values were unchanged in genotype-3 of HCV non-responders and in patients with genotype-1 of HCV regardless of response. This suggests that the reversal of hypocholesterolaemia in patients with chronic hepatitis C is related to the sustained viral response and viral genotype.",
      "\nAnswer: The present study aimed to see if life style interventions/weight reduction could decrease cathepsin L and S levels in blood plasma. However, the provided context does not mention any association between life style interventions and decreased levels of cathepsins L and S in plasma. It only mentions that higher cathepsin S was associated with higher CRP and IL-6 after 7 yr.",
      "\nAnswer: No, the provided context does not mention any association between a novel polymorphism of the CYP19 gene and essential hypertension in China. The context discusses the association between a polymorphism of the CYP11B2 gene and hypertension in the Chinese population, but not the CYP19 gene.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, different alternative splicing patterns - simple and complex ASEs - may be subject to opposite selection forces for protein reading frame preservation. Simple ASEs have higher frame preservation frequency preservation (FRFP) than constitutively spliced exons (CSEs), while complex ASEs have lower FRFPs than CSEs. Conservation of the ASE/CSE splicing pattern increases the FRFPs of simple ASEs but decreases those of complex ASEs. Contrary to the well-recognized concept of strong selection pressure on conserved ASEs for protein reading frame preservation, our results show that conserved complex ASEs are relaxed from such pressure and the frame-disrupting effect caused by the insertion of complex ASEs can be offset by compensatory changes in their flanking exons.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, high nuclear expression of HDGF correlates with disease progression and poor prognosis in human endometrial carcinoma. The study found that patients with increased HDGF expression levels had poorer overall survival rates than those with low expression of HDGF levels. Additionally, the study found that higher expression of nuclear HDGF was associated significantly with T stage and clinical stage, but there was no association with lymph node or distant metastasis.",
      "\nAnswer: The provided context does not mention any comparison between the initial assessment and follow-up of patients with Erdheim-Chester disease using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scanning. However, it does mention that whole-body scanning with 18F-FDG-PET was used in a large cohort of ECD patients from a single center to assess the value of this technique. Additionally, the study group comprised 43 presymptomatic (preHD) subjects carrying the HD mutation who underwent a 18F-FDG PET scan and were prospectively followed-up for at least 5 years using the unified HD rating scale to detect clinical changes. Multiple regression analysis included subject's age, CAG mutation size and glucose uptake as variables in a model to predict age at onset. Therefore, it can be inferred that 18F-FDG-PET scanning is useful in both the initial assessment and follow-up of patients with Erdheim-Chester disease.",

      "\nAnswer: Yes, the study shows that a genetic deletion of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (Mmp9) reverses ERP habituation deficits in Fmr1 KO mice. Although the N1 amplitude of Mmp9/Fmr1 DKO recordings was larger than WT and KO recordings, the habituation of ERPs in Mmp9/Fmr1 DKO mice is similar to WT mice implicating MMP-9 as a potential target for reversing sensory processing deficits in FXS.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, air quality influences the prevalence of hay fever and sinusitis. The study found a statistically significant relationship between air quality and the prevalence of hay fever and sinusitis. The standardized regression coefficient for hay fever and sinusitis was substantially larger than that for the control condition of kidney failure/weakening.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, S 23521 decreases food intake and body weight gain in diet-induced obese rats. The treatment significantly reduced cumulative energy intake, body weight gain, adiposity, and plasma triglyceride levels.",
      "\nAnswer: The study found that there were age-dependent differences in regional expression of NMDAR subunits and markers of glutamatergic, GABAergic, and monoaminergic systems. Additionally, there was a significantly greater elevation of GLUN2 autoantibodies in juvenile-compared to adult-infected mice. However, the study did not directly evaluate the relationship between anti-NMDA receptor autoantibodies and associated neurobehavioral pathology in mice dependent on age of first exposure to Toxoplasma gondii.",
      "\nAnswer: Based on the information provided, it appears that risedronate gastrointestinal absorption is not independent of site and rate of administration. In study A, no statistically significant site-specific differences in any pharmacokinetic parameter were observed. Additionally, in study B, the extent of risedronate absorption did not differ significantly following a rapid or a slow infusion. However, it is important to note that these studies were conducted in healthy male subjects and may not be generalizable to other populations.",
      "\nAnswer: No, the study does not provide evidence that neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin protects renal tubular epithelial cells in hypoxia-reperfusion by reducing apoptosis. The study aims to elucidate the role of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin in regulating apoptosis of tubular epithelial cells in a hypoxia-reperfusion model, but it does not provide evidence that neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin protects these cells.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, high body mass index (BMI) is associated with increased diurnal strains in the articular cartilage of the knee. Subjects with high BMI had significantly thicker cartilage on both the patella and femoral groove, as compared to subjects with normal BMI. Diurnal cartilage strains were dependent on location in the knee joint, as well as BMI. Subjects with high BMI, compared to those with normal BMI, exhibited significantly higher compressive strains in the tibial cartilage. However, there was no significant effect of BMI on diurnal cartilage strain in the femur.",
      "\nAnswer: The present study investigated the biochemical mechanisms of electroacupuncture (EA) anti-inflammation in a rat model. Experiment 1 measured plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels to see if EA regulates CORT secretion. Experiment 2 studied the effects of the adrenal gland on the therapeutic actions of EA using adrenalectomy (ADX) rats. Experiment 3 determined whether a prototypical glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, RU486, affects EA anti-edema. The study found that EA treatment, 10 Hz at 3 mA and 0.1 ms pulse width, was given twice, for 20 min each, once immediately after CFA administration and again 2 h post-CFA, significantly reduced plasma CORT levels, paw thickness, and paw withdrawal latency (PWL) 2 h and 5 h after the CFA injection. However, the study did not find that corticosterone mediate electroacupuncture-produced anti-edema in a rat model of inflammation.",
      "\nAnswer: No, soluble oncoprotein 185HER-2 in pleural fluid has limited usefulness for the diagnostic evaluation of malignant effusions.",
      "\nAnswer: No, the study did not investigate the effects of Bevacizumab on mitochondria isolated from human brain tumors. The study only investigated the direct effects of Temozolomide and Bevacizumab on the function of mitochondria and compared these effects on mitochondria isolated from low- and high-grade human brain tumors.",
      "\nAnswer: The study found no difference in diuresis, urine osmolality, or aquaporin-2 excretion between genders. However, there was a trend towards a higher reabsorption of free water in males. The excretion of prostaglandin E2 was also higher in males. There was no diurnal rhythm in p-oxytocin and no correlation to diuresis, urine osmolality, or aquaporin-2 excretions. Therefore, urinary concentration does not exclusively rely on plasma vasopressin.",
      "\nAnswer: No, plasma levels of angiostatin and endostatin are elevated for 2-4 weeks after colorectal cancer surgery.",
      "\nAnswer: No, adherence to the 2006 American Heart Association Diet and Lifestyle Recommendations for cardiovascular disease risk reduction is not associated with bone health in older Puerto Ricans. The study found no association between adherence to the AHA-DLR and bone mineral density at the femoral neck, trochanter, total hip, and lumbar spine (L2-L4) in a cross-sectional study of 933 Puerto Ricans aged 47-79 y.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, basophils are recruited to inflamed lungs in mice and humans. Adoptive transfer of basophils to OVA-sensitized hosts enhanced lung IL-4 and IL-13 release, while co-administration of OVA further aggravated airway inflammation and Th2 responses in LNs. In vitro studies revealed that pulmonary basophils interacted with lung CD4 effectors to increase T cell survival and Th2 cytokine expression at the single cell level, and amplified OVA-loaded DC-driven Th2 differentiation. Additionally, human basophils augmented in vitro IL-4 expression in effector memory CD4 T cells that include CRTH2(+) cells through IL-4 and TCR-independent pathways. However, the impact of basophils on the function of tissue CD4 effector T cells remains unknown.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, inhibition of Toll-like receptor 4 with eritoran attenuates myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.",
      "\nAnswer: No, the study did not investigate the time-dependent effects of beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate supplementation on Walker 256 tumor-bearing rats.

      "\nAnswer: No, nT-ProBNP does not predict rhythm stability after cardioversion of lone atrial fibrillation.",
      "\nAnswer: No indication of impairment to the haematological indices measured, hepatic function, or muscle damage was apparent after Cr supplementation. In contrast to previous reports, no detrimental effects of creatine supplementation on the renal function indices were observed in two-thirds nephrectomized or sham-operated animals. No differences were observed in inulin (0.28+/-0.08 vs 0.25+/-0.08 ml/min/100 g; P=NS) or creatinine clearance rates. Serum cystatin C concentration, urinary protein excretion, and albumin and urea clearance were comparable between creatine-supplemented and control-diet fed animals in both sham-operated and two-thirds nephrectomized animals. Serum creatine and intramuscular total creatine concentrations were higher in creatine-supplemented groups (P<0.05).",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, the cAMP effectors Epac and PKA are involved in the hepatic cystogenesis of an animal model of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease ( ARPKD ). The study found that both normal and PCK cholangiocytes increase their growth upon Epac-specific stimulation, while PKA-specific stimulation results in differential effects, suppressing proliferation in normal cholangiocytes but accelerating this process in PCK cholangiocytes. Additionally, pharmacological inhibitors and small interfering RNA-mediated gene silencing demonstrated the specificity of each effector activation, as well as the involvement of MEK-ERK1/2 signaling in all the observed effector-associated proliferation changes.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, chronic administration of either risperidone or clozapine results in alleviation of behavioral alterations mimicking some negative symptoms and partial amelioration of some cognitive defects in STOP null mice. Additionally, clozapine treatment also improves synaptic plasticity of the STOP null animals by restoring long-term potentiation in the hippocampus.",
      "\nAnswer: The provided context discusses a study that aimed to clarify whether the association between chlamydia pneumoniae (C pneumoniae) and atherosclerotic disease is based on C pneumoniae-induced transformation of a stable into an unstable atherosclerotic plaque or on stimulation of hypercoagulability leading to increased thrombotic arterial occlusions by C pneumoniae infection. The study used transcranial Doppler ultrasonographic monitoring of the middle cerebral artery during carotid endarterectomy to study atherothrombotic emboli dislodging from an unstable carotid plaque (plaque-related emboli) and emboli related to (excessive) thrombus formation at the endarterectomy site after removal of the plaque and restoration of flow (thrombosis-related emboli). However, the provided context does not specifically discuss the influence of C pneumoniae on atherosclerotic plaque behavior in patients with established carotid artery stenosis.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, moxibustion activates mast cell degranulation at the ST25 in rats with colitis.",
      "\nAnswer: The study found that optic nerve blood flow in primary open-angle glaucoma suspects with normal automated visual fields was not significantly different from that of age-matched controls or eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma."

      "A confirmation of the hypothesis would support efforts to generate a P. falciparum vaccine containing a comprehensive set of blood stage antigens, which, using adjuvant technology, would lead to the appropriate immunoglobulin subclass response. MEANS TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS: Detection of multiple immunorelevant P. falciparum blood stage antigens could be achieved by two-dimensional electrophoresis and blotting of the antigens onto nitrocellulose followed by exposure to the participant's serum. Bound immunoglobulins are visualized by isotype specific peroxidase conjugated anti-human immunoglobulin and quantified by transmission densitometry. The resulting pattern of responses for each immunoglobulin isotype could be compared between clinically immune participants remaining asymptomatic with subsequent P. falciparum infections and people who develop malaria. Immunorelevant antigens are identifiable by mass spectrometry with the fully decoded P. falciparum genome.",
      "Results indicated that the involvement of multiple recombination detection programs is very necessary. Additionally, results suggested two major challenges, one involving the difficulty of accurately determining the locations of breakpoints and the second involving identification of small regions of about 200 bases or fewer with greater caution. Both indicate the complexity of HIV-1 recombination. The resolution would depend critically on development of a recombination analysis algorithm, accumulation of HIV-1 stains, and a higher sequencing quality. With the changes in recombination pattern, phylogenetic relationships of some CRFs may also change. All these results may be critical to understand the role of recombination in a complex and dynamic HIV evolution.",

      "In this population, which included a high percentage of patients with luminal cancers, pCR did not predict for improved OS. Postneoadjuvant chemotherapy showed no discernible benefit even in subgroups with aggressive tumor biology or significant remaining tumor burden. The use of such treatment should therefore be discouraged outside of clinical trials.",

      "In this study, we find that simple and complex ASEs undergo opposite selection pressure for protein reading frame preservation, with CSEs in-between. Simple ASEs have much higher FRFPs than complex ones. We further find that the FRFPs of complex ASEs coupled with flanking exons are close to those of simple ASEs, indicating that neighboring exons of an ASE may evolve in a coordinated way to avoid protein dysfunction. Therefore, we suggest that evolutionary analyses of AS should take into consideration the effects of different splicing patterns and the joint effects of multiple AS events.",
      "Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that HDGF was expressed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. High nuclear expression of HDGF was positively correlated with FIGO stage (P = 0.032), but not associated with other clinical features, such as histological grading or lymph node status. Patients with high expression of HDGF had poorer overall survival rates than those with low expression of HDGF (P = 0.001). However, multivariate analyses showed that high nuclear expression of HDGF protein was not an independent predictor of prognosis for EC patients (P = 0.111). Our results suggest that high nuclear expression of HDGF is a potential unfavorable factor for the progression and prognosis of EC.",
      "The results of our large, single-center, retrospective study suggest that the findings of a FDG-PET scan may be interesting in the initial assessment of patients with ECD, but its greater contribution is in followup of these patients.",

      "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading known genetic cause of autism spectrum disorders. Individuals with FXS show symptoms of auditory hypersensitivity. These symptoms may arise due to sustained neural responses to repeated sounds, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. For the first time, this study shows deficits in habituation of neural responses to repeated sounds in the Fmr1 KO mice as seen in humans with FXS. We also report an abnormally high level of matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) in the auditory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice and that deletion of Mmp-9 from Fmr1 KO mice reverses habituation deficits. These data provide a translation relevant electrophysiological biomarker for sensory deficits in FXS and implicate MMP-9 as a target for drug discovery.",

In addition, the treatment also improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity of obese rats. These results strongly support S 23521 as a putative molecule for the treatment of obesity.",
      "Our study demonstrates that the age at first exposure to T. gondii is an important factor in shaping distinct behavioral and neurobiological abnormalities. Elevation in GLUN2 autoantibodies or complement protein C1q may be a potential underlying mechanism. A better understanding of these age-related differences may lead to more efficient treatments of behavioral disorders associated with T. gondii infection.",

These results also suggest that ectopic expression of NGAL in renal cells might provide a therapeutic strategy in ischemia-reperfusion by reducing apoptosis and promoting renal cell proliferation.",
      "Increased BMI is associated with increased diurnal strains in articular cartilage of both the medial and lateral compartments of the knee.

Oxytocin does not seem to play a role in the diurnal urine formation, whereas prostaglandin E2 could represent a mediator of the gender difference, not only as a mediator of the vasopressin response, but also as an independent factor. These findings need further elucidation.",

      "Laser Doppler flowmetry detected circulatory abnormalities in primary open-angle glaucoma suspects who did not have any manifest visual field defect. Decreases in flow in glaucoma suspects were similar in magnitude to those of subjects with primary open-angle glaucoma. These data suggest that impaired optic nerve blood flow develops early in the glaucomatous process and does not develop solely as a result of glaucoma damage."
