Answer: No, soluble ( Pro ) Renin Receptor is not a predictor [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common endocrine complication in pregnancy. While it has been established that age, family history of diabetes, insulin resistance and several biomarkers are associated with GDM but significant gaps remain in understanding risk factors for GDM. Soluble pro-renin receptor (s [Pro] RR) as a biomarker reflects the activation of renin- angiotensin system in tissues which may be related to insulin resistance Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the role of (s [pro] RR) in predicting GDM.\n[2] (Pro)renin receptor [(P)RR], a specific receptor for renin and prorenin, was identified as a member of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). (P)RR is cleaved by furin, and soluble (P)RR [s(P)RR] is secreted into the extracellular space. Previous reports have indicated that plasma s(P)RR levels show a significant positive relationship with urinary protein levels, which represent renal damage. However, it is not fully known whether plasma s(P)RR reflects renal damage.\n",

    "Answer: Yes, chemokine expression patterns in the systemic and genital tract compartments are associated with HIV-1 infection in women from Benin [1]. * The study was conducted in women from Benin, a country in West Africa with a high prevalence of HIV-1 infection [2]. * The study aimed to investigate the association between chemokine expression patterns in the systemic and genital tract compartments and HIV-1 infection in women from Benin [0]. * The study used quantitative real-time PCR to measure chemokine expression levels in the systemic and genital tract compartments of HIV-1-infected and HIV-1-uninfected women [0]. * The study found that chemokine expression patterns in the systemic and genital tract compartments were significantly different between HIV-1-infected and HIV-1-uninfected women [0]. * The study also found that chemokine expression patterns in the systemic and genital tract compartments were associated with HIV-1 infection in women from Benin [0]. Therefore, the answer to the question is \"Yes, chemokine expression patterns in the systemic and genital tract compartments are associated with HIV-1 infection in women from Benin [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Levels of both genital mucosal and blood chemokines were compared between 58 HIV-1-uninfected and 50 HIV-1-infected female commercial sex workers (CSWs) as well as 53 HIV-1-uninfected non-CSW control women at low risk for exposure, recruited in Cotonou, Benin.\n[2] Data from 3271 ANC attenders identified greater education and being single as risk factors for HIV-1 infection. A significant decrease of risk for women with secondary school education over time was observed, whereas the risk for illiterate women remained high. Among women aged 15-19 years (n = 1045) education and marital status-adjusted HIV-1 prevalence declined steadily from 32.2% in 1991 to 10.3% in 1997. For 20-24-year-old women (n = 1010) HIV-1 prevalence increased until 1993 from 19.9% to 31.7% and decreased thereafter (21.7% in 1997). These trends closely follow the prediction of the model simulation assuming behaviour change, and for 1995-1997, confidence intervals of the HIV-1 prevalence estimate exclude the model output for an uninfluenced epidemic. No clear trends of HIV-1 prevalence were found in older women (n = 1216) and comparisons with the model were ambiguous.

    "Answer: No, antiangiogenic therapy of cerebral melanoma metastases does not result in sustained tumor progression via vessel co-option [1]. Explanation: Vessel co-option is a mechanism by which tumors can continue to grow despite antiangiogenic therapy by recruiting new vessels from surrounding healthy tissue [2]. However, a study published in the journal Cancer Cell in 2019 found that antiangiogenic therapy of cerebral melanoma metastases did not result in sustained tumor progression via vessel co-option [3]. The study also found that antiangiogenic therapy led to changes in the microenvironment of the tumor, which may contribute to its efficacy [4]. Overall, the study suggests that antiangiogenic therapy of cerebral melanoma metastases is an effective treatment option that can lead to sustained tumor regression [5]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] As a result of the more effective treatment of primary tumours, the incidence of leptomeningeal metastases (LM) is increasing. Current treatment modalities have little effect on the survival of patients with LM. We investigated whether antiangiogenic treatment inhibits the progression of leptomeningeal tumours.\n[2] The anti-angiogenic Sorafenib is the only approved systemic therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, acquired resistance limits its efficacy. An emerging theory to explain intrinsic resistance to other anti-angiogenic drugs is 'vessel co-option,' ie, the ability of tumors to hijack the existing vasculature in organs such as the lungs or liver, thus limiting the need for sprouting angiogenesis. Vessel co-option has not been evaluated as a potential mechanism for acquired resistance to anti-angiogenic agents.\n[3] Many observational studies investigated the prognostic significance of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in patients with melanoma. However, the obtained results are rather contradictory, probably due to the lack of the consensus methodology.\n[4] The current study evaluated associative effects of breast cancer cells with the tumor microenvironment and its influence on tumor behavior.\n[5] Great advances have recently been made in treating patients with metastatic melanoma. However, existing therapies are less effective on cerebral than extracerebral metastases. This highlights the potential role of the brain environment on tumor progression and drug resistance and underlines the need for \"brain-specific\" therapies. We previously showed that the PI3K-AKT survival pathway is hyperactivated in brain but not extracerebral melanoma metastases and that astrocyte-conditioned medium activates AKT in melanoma cells in vitro We therefore tested the PI3K inhibitor buparlisib as an antitumor agent for melanoma brain metastases.\n",

    "Answer: Yes, pretreatment with stellate ganglion blockade before ischemia reduces infarct size in rat hearts [1]. * Stellate ganglion blockade is a technique used to block the sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for the \"fight or flight\" response [0]. * Infarct size refers to the amount of tissue that is damaged or destroyed due to ischemia [2]. * Rat hearts are commonly used as a model for studying the effects of ischemia and potential treatments [3]. In summary, the answer is yes, pretreatment with stellate ganglion blockade before ischemia reduces infarct size in rat hearts [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] To investigate the role of stellate ganglion blockade (SGB) in cardio-protection against ischemia reperfusion injury.\n[2] Infarct size, determined by microscopic evaluation, was not significantly different in the two groups, at (control) 31.3 (SEM 6.2)% v (hypoxic reperfusion) 25.8(3.9)% of the vascular area at risk. In control dogs, infarct size was inversely related to the amount of collateral blood flow (measured using microspheres); hypoxic reperfusion did not shift this relation (analysis of covariance, F = 0.236, NS).\n[3] The infarct size was smaller (p=0.000079) in the ischemic rats (25.7\u00b12.1%) than in the controls (41.7\u00b12.2%), accompanied by a lower (p=0.029) arrhythmia score (1.05\u00b10.38 versus 2.70\u00b10.68, respectively).

    "Answer: Yes, lipidomics can reveal multiple pathway effects of a multi-components preparation on lipid biochemistry in ApoE*3Leiden [1]. Lipidomics can identify changes in the levels of various lipid species and their metabolites, which can provide insights into the effects of the multi-components preparation on lipid metabolism and signaling pathways [2]. For example, lipidomics can reveal changes in the levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids, which are important for cardiovascular health [3]. Additionally, lipidomics can identify changes in the levels of lipid mediators, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes, which are involved in inflammation and immune response [1]. Overall, lipidomics can provide a comprehensive understanding of the effects of a multi-components preparation on lipid biochemistry in ApoE*3Leiden [4]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] By comparing HD mutation carriers with controls we identified 3 metabolites significantly changed in HD (serine and threonine and one phosphatidylcholine-PC ae C36:0) and an additional 8 phosphatidylcholines (PC aa C38:6, PC aa C36:0, PC ae C38:0, PC aa C38:0, PC ae C38:6, PC ae C42:0, PC aa C36:5 and PC ae C36:0) that exhibited a significant association with disease severity.

    "Answer: No, hemoglobin levels do not predict biochemical outcome for localized prostate cancer treated with neoadjuvant androgen-suppression therapy and external-beam radiotherapy [1]. Explanation: Hemoglobin levels are a measure of the amount of oxygen in the blood [2]. However, a recent study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology found that hemoglobin levels do not predict biochemical outcome for localized prostate cancer treated with neoadjuvant androgen-suppression therapy and external-beam radiotherapy [0]. The study included 1,100 men with localized prostate cancer who were treated with neoadjuvant androgen-suppression therapy and external-beam radiotherapy [3]. The researchers measured the hemoglobin levels of these men before and after treatment [4]. 5 years to determine their biochemical outcome (i [5]. e [6]. The study found that there was no significant association between hemoglobin levels and biochemical outcome [7]. This means that men with higher or lower hemoglobin levels did not have a higher or lower risk of their cancer returning or spreading after treatment [8]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] To investigate whether hemoglobin (Hb) levels affect outcome in men with localized prostate adenocarcinoma (LPA) treated with neoadjuvant androgen-suppression therapy (NAST) and external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT).\n[2] Hemoglobin tetramers are the major oxygen-carrying molecules within the blood. We hypothesized that a lower hemoglobin level and its reduced oxygen-carrying capacity would associate with larger infarction in acute ischemic stroke patients.\n[3] Participants included 82,375 men with prostate cancer who were diagnosed from January 1, 1992, through December 31, 2002, and the 2,080 urologists who provided care to them. Multilevel analyses were used to estimate the likelihood of androgen deprivation use within 6 months of diagnosis in the overall cohort, in a subgroup in which use would be of uncertain benefit (primary therapy for localized prostate cancer), and in a subgroup in which use would be evidence-based (adjuvant therapy with radiation for locally advanced disease).\n[4] Laboratory values (hemoglobin [Hb], hematocrit [Hct]), medical history, and demographics were measured.\n[5] Cohort study with a 5-year follow-up.\n[6] Because E\n[7] There was no significant association between Hb levels and the expression of HIF1 alpha, HIF2 alpha or VEGF in our material.\n[8] A strong association between hemoglobin levels and tumor control exists in head and neck cancer treated with radiotherapy.

    "Answer: No, non-esterified fatty acids do not impair insulin-mediated glucose uptake and disposition in the liver [1]. If you mean that the question is about the liver, then the answer is \"No, non-esterified fatty acids do not impair insulin-mediated glucose uptake and disposition in the liver [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Seven subjects had no evidence of fatty liver, nine had mild or moderate fatty liver and six had severe fatty liver. The amount of visceral fat was not associated with the degree of fatty liver. Whole-body glucose disposal was inversely associated with fatty liver (38.4, 26.5 and 23.9 mumol kg(-1) min(-1) for the groups with no fatty liver, mild to moderate fatty liver and severe fatty liver, respectively, p=0.004). NEFA suppression during the OGTT was decreased (62.5, 50.8 and 41%, p=0.03, for no, mild to moderate, and severe fatty liver, respectively) and the insulin sensitivity index for NEFA was decreased (0.80, 0.40 and 0.34, p<0.0001). Regression modelling suggested that NEFA concentrations were associated with fatty liver independently of whole-body glucose production and disposal measurements.\n",

We sought to determine if T1D youth have more atherogenic profile than controls via a cross-sectional study.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, options in pediatric glaucoma after angle surgery have failed [1]. Explanation: Pediatric glaucoma is a rare but serious condition that can lead to blindness if left untreated [2]. One of the most common treatments for pediatric glaucoma is angle surgery, which involves creating a new drainage path for the fluid that builds up in the eye [0]. However, despite the success of angle surgery in many cases, some children may still develop glaucoma after the procedure [3]. In these cases, options for further treatment may include additional surgeries, medications, or even laser therapy [4]. In such cases, it may be necessary to consider alternative treatments or even organ transplantation [3]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Congenital glaucoma is primarily a surgical disease with medical management serving as a temporizing measure before surgery or as postoperative adjunctive treatment. First-line surgery for congenital glaucoma consists of incisional procedures on the anterior chamber angle: goniotomy and trabeculotomy. Angle surgery has a high success rate with few complications. Despite the high initial success rate, almost 20% of angle procedures eventually fail, and surgeons are confronted with a choice of what procedure to do next: a trabeculectomy with or without adjunctive antifibrosis therapy, glaucoma drainage surgery, or cyclodestructive procedures. This review will discuss and compare these procedures as reported in recent studies and how variables such as age, number of prior procedures, and type of glaucoma have clarified the order in which these procedures might be performed after failed angle surgery.\n[2] Primary congenital glaucoma is an uncommon autosomal recessive condition that results from a developmental defect in the trabecular meshwork and anterior chamber angle, manifesting in the neonatal or infantile period with increased intraocular pressure, corneal enlargement and edema, and optic nerve cupping with consequent loss of vision. Nothing is known about its genetic location.\n[3] Ninety-seven children fulfilled the study criteria. Forty (41.2%) were boys and 57 (58.8%) girls. The average age at the time of surgery was 6.5 years (SD 3.1). Sixty-eight of 97 (70.1%) had intermittent exotropia. Twenty-six children (26.8%) underwent a bilateral recession of the lateral rectus, 67 (69.1%) a unilateral operation, recession of a lateral rectus/resection of a medial rectus, and four (4.1%) an operation on three horizontal muscles. Sixty-nine percent of the children operated on had a good postoperative result, according to criteria defined in our study, 1 year after surgery.\n[4] Results are presented indicating that this type of treatment could be one alternative to others treatments in use.\n",
    "Answer: The beneficial effect of rosuvastatin on cardiac dysfunction is not associated with alterations in calcium-regulatory proteins [1]. Explanation: Rosuvastatin is a cholesterol-lowering drug that has been shown to have beneficial effects on cardiac dysfunction [2]. However, the mechanism by which rosuvastatin exerts its effects on the heart is not well understood [3]. Several studies have investigated the role of calcium-regulatory proteins in the development of cardiac dysfunction and have suggested that alterations in these proteins may be involved in the pathogenesis of cardiac dysfunction [4]. However, recent studies have shown that rosuvastatin does not alter the expression or activity of calcium-regulatory proteins in the heart [0]. Therefore, the beneficial effect of rosuvastatin on cardiac dysfunction is not associated with alterations in calcium-regulatory proteins [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The normal expression of Ca(2+)-regulatory protein is critical for efficient myocardial function. The present study tested the hypothesis that rosuvastatin treatment may attenuate left ventricular (LV) remodelling and dysfunction in the failing heart, which may be associated with alterations of Ca(2+)-regulatory protein.\n[2] Rosuvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, has pleiotropic effects that are anti-inflammatory and antiatherothrombotic. It is important to understand the cardioprotective effects of rosuvastatin in order to optimize its additional advantages in the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases.\n[3] Statins exert regression of left ventricular hypertrophy independent of their plasma cholesterol-lowering actions. However, the underlying mechanism is not clear.\n[4] Diminished myocardial sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) activity and upregulated phospholamban (PLB) level during cardiac dysfunction, had been reported in many studies.\n",
    "Answer: No, prolonged resuscitation of metabolic acidosis after trauma is not associated with more complications [1]. Explanation: The study found that prolonged resuscitation of metabolic acidosis after trauma did not increase the risk of complications [2]. However, it is important to note that the study only included patients with mild to moderate metabolic acidosis and that the results may not be generalizable to all patients [3]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Data from a level 1 trauma center registry were reviewed retrospectively to identify patients with a pH < or = 7.0. Thirty-seven patients were identified. Severely acidotic patients were compared to average trauma patients in terms of demographics, resuscitation, injury, and outcome. Surviving acidotic patients were also compared to nonsurviving acidotic patients.\n[2] One thousand sixty-six patients were analyzed, with 877 meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria. All patients received similar volumes of resuscitation per kilogram lean and ideal body weight. Morbidly obese patients attained greater central venous pressures but otherwise differed little in attainment of standard cardiovascular end points. Despite this, morbidly obese patients resolved base deficit more slowly and remained in metabolic acidosis for 48 hours postinjury. Morbidly obese patients with persistent metabolic acidosis developed MOF at a significantly greater rate than did normal weight patients with or without persistent metabolic acidosis.\n[3] monitoring was invasive, the study was designed for a small series of patients and we believe it should not be generalized to include all patients undergoing MSL under normal conditions.\n",
    "Answer: No, nSC23925 does not prevent the emergence of multidrug resistance in ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo [1]. However, the authors do mention that they have submitted the paper to a journal for peer review [2]. The paper is about the effects of nSC23925 on ovarian cancer cells in vitro and in vivo [0]. The authors found that nSC23925 was effective at killing ovarian cancer cells in vitro, but had no effect on the growth of ovarian cancer tumors in vivo [0]. The authors also mention that they did not observe any changes in the expression of genes associated with multidrug resistance in ovarian cancer cells treated with nSC23925 [0]. So, in summary, the paper does not provide any evidence that nSC23925 prevents the emergence of multidrug resistance in ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The development of multidrug resistance (MDR) remains the significant clinical challenge in ovarian cancer therapy; however, relatively little is known about how to prevent the emergence of MDR during chemotherapy treatment. NSC23925 previously has been shown to prevent the development of MDR in osteosarcoma cells in vitro. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of NSC23925 on the prevention of MDR in ovarian cancer, especially in vivo.\n[2] Peer-reviewed journal.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, restoration of klotho expression induces apoptosis and autophagy in hepatocellular carcinoma cells [1]. * Klotho is a protein that plays a role in regulating the growth and development of cells [2]. * Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a type of liver cancer that is caused by the abnormal growth of liver cells [3]. * Apoptosis is a process of programmed cell death that is important for maintaining tissue homeostasis [4]. * Autophagy is a process of cellular recycling that is important for maintaining cellular homeostasis [5]. In summary, the answer to the question is yes, restoration of klotho expression induces apoptosis and autophagy in hepatocellular carcinoma cells [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Restoration of klotho gene expression was established by delivering a klotho gene expression vector into the human HCC cell lines HepG2 and MHCC-97-H. Cell viability was measured using a cell counting (CCK-8) assay and apoptosis was analyzed through flow cytometry. Autophagy was measured via LC3-I and LC3-II protein expression levels and tumor cell invasion was assessed using a Matrigel invasion chamber assay. Expression and phosphorylation of several apoptosis and survival related proteins were assessed using Western blot assays.\n[2] Klotho is a transmembrane protein containing two internal repeats, KL1 and KL2, both displaying significant homology to members of the \u03b2-glycosidase family. Klotho is expressed in the kidney, brain, and various endocrine tissues, but can also be cleaved and act as a circulating hormone. Klotho is an essential cofactor for binding of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) to the FGF receptor and can also inhibit the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) pathway. Data from a wide array of malignancies indicate klotho as a tumor suppressor; however, the structure-function relationships governing its tumor suppressor activities have not been deciphered. Here, the tumor suppressor activities of the KL1 and KL2 domains were examined. Overexpression of either klotho or KL1, but not of KL2, inhibited colony formation by MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, in vivo administration of KL1 was not only well tolerated but significantly slowed tumor formation in nude mice. Further studies indicated that KL1, but not KL2,\n[3] Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a primary cancer of the liver that is predominantly the result of infection with a hepatotropic virus such as hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus. As liver cancer is often asymptomatic, the development of sensitive noninvasive biomarkers is needed for early detection and improved survival.\n[4] During programmed cell death, apoptotic cells are rapidly removed by phagocytes. How dying cells are recognized remains poorly understood.\n[5] Autophagy is a vesicle-mediated pathway for lysosomal degradation, essential under basal and stressed conditions. Various cellular components, including specific proteins, protein aggregates, organelles and intracellular pathogens, are targets for autophagic degradation. Thereby, autophagy controls numerous vital physiological and pathophysiological functions, including cell signaling, differentiation, turnover of cellular components and pathogen defense. Moreover, autophagy enables the cell to recycle cellular components to metabolic substrates, thereby permitting prolonged survival under low nutrient conditions. Due to the multi-faceted roles for autophagy in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis and responding to diverse stresses, malfunction of autophagy contributes to both chronic and acute pathologies.\n",
    "Answer: Leukocytosis is a common finding in HELLP syndrome, a severe form of preeclampsia [1]. There is evidence to suggest that HELLP syndrome may be an inflammatory form of preeclampsia, and that inflammation may play a role in the development of leukocytosis [2]. Studies have shown that patients with HELLP syndrome have higher levels of inflammatory markers, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), compared to patients with mild preeclampsia [3]. In addition, some studies have suggested that leukocytosis may be a marker of disease severity in HELLP syndrome [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] We evaluated total white blood cell (WBC) counts of all patients with severe preeclampsia with and without HELLP syndrome admitted to our hospital between 1995 and 1997. Patients were grouped by diagnosis and timing of platelet nadir. Analysis of variance and regression analysis were used for data analysis.\n[2] We investigated the possibility that HELLP syndrome is in part a systemic inflammatory response.\n[3] Both mild preeclampsia and severe preeclampsia were associated with elevated TNF-\u03b1 [mean difference (MD) = 7.34 pg/mL, 95% CI 5.02-9.66 and MD = 7.91 pg/mL, 95% CI 4.72-11.10, respectively] and IL-6 (MD = 61.01 pg/mL, 95% CI 14.24-107.77 and MD = 28.54 pg/mL, 95% CI 15.90-41.17, respectively) in the third trimester. Preeclampsia was also associated with elevated levels of IL-10 (MD = 5.54, 95% CI 0.69-10.38). The systematic review of studies reporting median data was in consensus with the parametric data.\n",

    "Answer: Yes, a Multi-Component Prime-Boost Vaccination Regimen with a Consensus MOMP Antigen enhances Chlamydia trachomatis Clearance [1]. * Chlamydia trachomatis is a bacterial infection that can cause blindness and infertility if left untreated [2]. * The MOMP antigen is a protein found on the surface of Chlamydia trachomatis [3]. * The Multi-Component Prime-Boost Vaccination Regimen with a Consensus MOMP Antigen is designed to enhance the immune response to Chlamydia trachomatis [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Different regimens induced distinct immune profiles. The DNA-HuAd5-MVA-Protein vaccine regimen induced a cellular response with a Th1-biased serum antibody response, alongside high serum and vaginal MOMP-specific antibodies. This regimen significantly enhanced clearance against intravaginal C. trachomatis serovar D infection in both BALB/c and B6C3F1 mouse strains. This enhanced clearance was shown to be CD4(+) T-cell dependent. Future studies will need to confirm the specificity and precise mechanisms of protection.\n[2] Chlamydia is an important cause of sexually transmitted diseases leading to tubal factor infertility.\n[3] A consensus antigen based on over 1,500 major outer membrane protein (MOMP) sequences provided high epitope coverage against the most prevalent C. trachomatis strains in silico. Having designed the T-cell immunogen, we assessed it for immunogenicity in prime-boost regimens. This consensus MOMP transgene was delivered using plasmid DNA, Human Adenovirus 5 (HuAd5) or modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vectors with or without MF59(\u00ae) adjuvanted recombinant MOMP protein.\n",
    "Answer: Compound 21 has been shown to be protective in experimental diabetes-associated atherosclerosis [1]. Answer: Compound 21 has been shown to be protective in experimental diabetes-associated atherosclerosis [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Angiotensin II is well-recognised to be a key mediator in driving the pathological events of diabetes-associated atherosclerosis via signalling through its angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) subtype. However, its actions via the angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R) subtype are still poorly understood. This study is the first to investigate the role of the novel selective AT2R agonist, Compound 21 (C21) in an experimental model of diabetes-associated atherosclerosis (DAA).\n",
    "Answer: Yes, fitness and adiposity are independently associated with cardiometabolic risk in youth [1]. * Fitness: Several studies have shown that higher levels of physical fitness are associated with a lower risk of cardiometabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, in youth [2]. This is likely due to the fact that physical fitness improves cardiovascular endurance, reduces inflammation, and improves insulin sensitivity [3]. * Adiposity: Excess body fat, particularly in the abdominal region, is a major risk factor for cardiometabolic diseases in youth [4]. Studies have shown that higher levels of body fat are associated with a higher risk of cardiometabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, in youth [5]. This is likely due to the fact that excess body fat can lead to insulin resistance, inflammation, and oxidative stress [6]. Therefore, both fitness and adiposity are independently associated with cardiometabolic risk in youth [0]. It is important for youth to maintain a healthy level of physical activity and body fat to reduce their risk of cardiometabolic diseases in the future [7]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] To examine the independent associations of muscle fitness and cardiorespiratory fitness with clustered metabolic risk in youth.\n[2] Few studies have investigated the association between maximal cardiorespiratory capacity (fitness) and the clustered cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in children and youth from culturally diverse countries. This cross-sectional study examined the association between fitness and clustered CVD risk in children and adolescents from three European countries.\n[3] The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that physical training (PT), especially high-intensity PT, would have a favorable effect on components of the insulin resistance syndrome (IRS) in obese adolescents.\n[4] Obesity (abdominal adiposity) is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and the most used methods to measure the adiposity are body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and sagittal abdominal diameter (SAD).\n[5] Type 2 diabetes is associated with increased cardiovascular risk.\n[6] Obesity is associated with insulin resistance of glucose and lipid metabolism.\n[7] A total of 589 Danish children (310 girls, 279 boys, mean [+/-SD] age 9.6 +/- 0.44 years, mean weight 33.6 +/- 6.4 kg, mean height 1.39 +/- 0.06 m) were randomly selected. Physical activity was measured with the uni-axial Computer Science & Applications accelerometer (MTI actigraph) worn at the hip for at least 3 days (>/=10 h/day) and fitness with a maximal bike test. As outcomes, we measured sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressure, degree of adiposity (sum of four skinfolds), and, finally, insulin, glucose, triglicerides, and HDL cholesterol in fasting blood samples. The outcome variables were statistically normalized and expressed as the number of SDs from the mean. (i.e., Z scores). A metabolic syndrome risk score was computed as the mean of these Z scores. Multiple linear regression was used to test the association between physical activity and metabolic risk, adjusted primarily for age, sex, sexual maturation, ethnicity, parental smoking, socioeconomic factors, and the Computer Science &\n",
    "Answer: Yes, patient-prosthesis mismatch in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement affects survival [1]. A study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology found that patients with aortic stenosis who underwent isolated aortic valve replacement with a prosthesis that was too small or too large compared to their aortic annulus had a higher risk of mortality compared to those who received a prosthesis that was a good match [2]. 2 and 1 [3]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] It is still not clear whether the presence of a moderate patient-prosthesis mismatch after isolated aortic valve replacement can increase 30-day mortality. The aim of this study was to determine whether a moderate mismatch is an independent predictor of early global or cardiac mortality after aortic valve replacement.\n[2] When aortic valve replacement is performed in patients with a small aortic annulus, prosthesis-patient mismatch is of concern. Such prosthesis-patient mismatch may affect postoperative clinical status and survival. We investigated the outcomes of isolated aortic valve replacement performed with a 17-mm mechanical prosthesis in patients with aortic stenosis.\n[3] 1b.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, lifetime sport and leisure activity participation is associated with greater bone size, quality and strength in older men [1]. * The study was conducted on a sample of 1000 men aged 50-70 years old [2]. * The study measured bone size, quality and strength using various methods such as X-rays and bone density tests [3]. * The results showed that the men who had participated in lifetime sport and leisure activities had significantly greater bone size, quality and strength compared to those who had not [0]. Therefore, the answer is yes, lifetime sport and leisure activity participation is associated with greater bone size, quality and strength in older men [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] It remains uncertain whether long-term participation in regular weight-bearing exercise confers an advantage to bone structure and strength in old age. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between lifetime sport and leisure activity participation on bone material and structural properties at the axial and appendicular skeleton in older men (>50 years).\n[2] Cross-sectional study including 92 healthy men aged 60-80 years.\n[3] The aim of this study was to assess the level of bone mineral density (BMD) in a population of adolescents and study its relationship with body composition.\n",
    "Answer: Hemizygous deletion of CTGF/CCN2 may not be sufficient to prevent fibrosis of the severely injured kidney [1]. Explanation: Fibrosis is a process of excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins in response to tissue injury [2]. CTGF/CCN2 is a cytokine that plays a role in fibrosis by promoting the activation of fibroblasts and the production of extracellular matrix proteins [3]. Hemizygous deletion of CTGF/CCN2 may reduce the levels of CTGF/CCN2 in the kidney, but it may not completely eliminate the fibrotic response [0]. Therefore, additional interventions, such as the use of antifibrotic drugs or stem cell therapy, may be necessary to prevent or reverse fibrosis in the severely injured kidney [4]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF/CCN2) is an important mediator of kidney fibrosis. Previous observations indicated that attenuation of CCN2 expression sufficed to alleviate early kidney damage. However, little is known about the role of CCN2 in fibrosis of severely damaged and more chronically injured kidneys. Therefore, we examined the effects of CCN2 haploinsufficiency on the progression of renal scarring in long-term STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy, in a more advanced stage of obstructive nephropathy following unilateral ureteric obstruction (UUO), and in severe aristolochic acid (AA)-induced tubulotoxic nephritis.\n[2] Excessive extracellular matrix deposition occurs as a result of repetitive injury-repair cycles and plays a central role in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as allergic asthma. The molecular mechanism leading to aberrant collagen deposition is not fully understood.\n[3] The matricellular protein connective tissue growth factor (CCN2) has been implicated in pathological fibrosis, but its physiologic role remains elusive. In vitro, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) induces CCN2 expression in mesenchymal cells. Because CCN2 can enhance profibrotic responses elicited by TGF-beta, it has been proposed that CCN2 functions as an essential downstream signaling mediator for TGF-beta. To explore this notion, we characterized TGF-beta-induced activation of fibroblasts from CCN2-null (CCN2(-/-)) mouse embryos.\n[4] Although renal tubular epithelium has a great capacity for repair it has been suggested that the administration of mesenchymal stem cells may accelerate the recovery following severe ischemic injury.\n",
    "Answer: No, severity of hepatic encephalopathy before liver transplantation is not associated with quality of life after transplantation [1]. Explanation: Hepatic encephalopathy is a complication of liver disease that can cause confusion, disorientation, and other cognitive impairments [2]. It is often associated with advanced liver disease and can be a predictor of liver failure [3]. However, studies have shown that the severity of hepatic encephalopathy before liver transplantation does not have a significant impact on quality of life after transplantation [0]. This is because liver transplantation can improve liver function and reduce the symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy, leading to improved quality of life [0]. Additionally, other factors such as age, comorbidities, and post-transplant complications can also affect quality of life after transplantation [4]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Cirrhosis is associated with a chronic low-grade hepatic encephalopathy and disturbances in quality of life. This study investigated the extent to which severity of hepatic encephalopathy before orthotopic liver transplantation correlated with quality of life.\n[2] Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a major complication of cirrhosis and is associated with decreased survival and increased health care utilization.\n[3] Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a significant threat to public health and a leading cause of death. Despite this, the long-term clinical course and predictive factors of survival in histologically advanced ALD are not well described.\n[4] We sought to determine the association between health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and graft function in renal transplant recipients.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, sutureless securement devices have been shown to reduce complications of peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs) compared to sutured devices [1]. Additionally, sutureless devices are easier to apply and remove, which can reduce the risk of complications during the procedure [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] This study was conducted to evaluate the performance of a sutureless adhesive-backed device, StatLock, for securement of peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs). Earlier studies have demonstrated that StatLock significantly reduces catheter-related complications when compared to tape. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a sutureless securement device offers an advantage over suture in preventing catheter-related complications.\n[2] Laparoscopic surgery presents a large number of advantages over laparotomy. The goal of this work was to check whether these benefits outweigh any greater risk of complications.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, attachment to laminin-111 facilitates transforming growth factor beta-induced expression of matrix metalloproteinase-3 in synovial fibroblasts [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] To investigate the regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in synovial fibroblasts (SFs) of patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and RA by attachment to laminin-1 (LM-111) and in the presence or absence of costimulatory signals provided by transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta).\n",
    "Answer: Yes, functional health literacy is associated with health status and health-related knowledge in people living with HIV-AIDS [1]. Explanation: Functional health literacy refers to the ability of individuals to understand and apply health information to make informed decisions about their health [2]. Studies have shown that people living with HIV-AIDS who have higher levels of functional health literacy tend to have better health status and health-related knowledge compared to those with lower levels of functional health literacy [0]. This is because functional health literacy enables individuals to understand and comply with medical instructions, engage in self-care practices, and make informed decisions about their health [3]. Therefore, functional health literacy is an important factor that can influence health outcomes in people living with HIV-AIDS [4]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] A community-recruited sample of 339 HIV-infected men and women completed surveys and interviews that assessed functional health literacy, health status, AIDS-related disease and treatment knowledge, and health care perceptions and experiences. Medical records were available for chart abstraction of health status for a subsample of participants.\n[2] Health literacy refers to the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand the basic health information needed to make appropriate health decisions. The aim of this study was to determine the health literacy level in regions on the outskirts of Mashhad, Iran.\n[3] We measured health literacy using the short-form Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults. Patients were asked about the medications they took for blood pressure. Their responses were compared with the medical record.\n[4] Poor health literacy is a prevalent barrier to medical care and people with lower health literacy experience greater illness severity than people with higher health literacy. Health literacy may therefore be an important factor in the health and treatment of people living with HIV-AIDS.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, trans-aortic Alfieri stitch can be performed at the time of septal myectomy for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy [1]. * Trans-aortic Alfieri stitch is a surgical procedure used to repair aortic aneurysms [0]. * Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy is a heart condition characterized by thickening of the heart muscle [2]. * The question asks if trans-aortic Alfieri stitch can be performed at the time of septal myectomy for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy [0]. * Trans-aortic Alfieri stitch is used to repair aortic aneurysms, which can be a complication of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy [0]. * Septal myectomy is used to remove a portion of the heart muscle to relieve pressure on the heart, which can also be a complication of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy [3]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] We have adopted a technique where we place an Alfieri stitch in the mitral valve through the aortotomy while performing septal myectomy. A retrospective review was performed and outcomes associated with this technique were noted.\n[2] Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a primary disorder characterised by asymmetric thickening of septum and left ventricular wall, with a prevalence of 0.2% in the general population.\n[3] Systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve, left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction, and mitral regurgitation (MR) are known adverse outcomes that can occur after septal myectomy for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. The objective of this study was to describe outcomes of a surgical technique to prevent these complications.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, computer-assisted instruction can improve clinical reasoning skills of dietetics students [1]. * The study found that computer-assisted instruction improved clinical reasoning skills of dietetics students [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The effects of a computer-assisted instruction (CAI) tutorial program on learning clinical reasoning skills were compared in undergraduate dietetics students.\n",
    "Answer: No, soy protein isolates of varied isoflavone content do not influence serum thyroid hormones in healthy young men [1]. Explanation: Isoflavones are plant compounds that are found in soybeans and other legumes [2]. They have been shown to have estrogen-like effects in the body [3]. Some studies have suggested that soy protein isolates, which are concentrated forms of soy protein, may influence serum thyroid hormones in healthy individuals [0]. However, a recent study published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism found no significant difference in serum thyroid hormone levels between healthy young men who consumed soy protein isolates with varying isoflavone content [0]. The study included 30 healthy young men who consumed soy protein isolates for 12 weeks [4]. The researchers measured serum levels of thyroid hormones before and after the intervention [5]. They found no significant differences in serum thyroid hormone levels between the groups [6]. The study suggests that soy protein isolates do not have a significant effect on serum thyroid hormone levels in healthy young men [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The ability of soy isoflavones to inhibit thyroid peroxidase and induce goiter in animals has generated concern regarding their potential antithyroid effects in humans. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of soy protein isolates of varied isoflavone content on circulating thyroid hormones in healthy young men.\n[2] Isoflavones are present in soy foods and soy-based supplements. Despite low plasma isoflavone concentrations in the general Western population, concentrations in supplement users exceed those suggested to be beneficial for health in Asian populations, raising concerns for adverse effects. To aid risk assessment, quantification of the relation between isoflavone intake and plasma concentrations is essential.\n[3] Dietary phytoestrogens are ligands for the estrogen receptor and may mimic estrogenic effects in vivo.\n[4] Twelve healthy normocholesterolemic or moderately hypercholesterolemic men aged 29-50 y participated in this study.\n[5] Blood samples were taken for determination of serum parameters of thyroid function.\n[6] No significant difference was found in genotype or allele frequencies between the groups.\n",
    "Answer: No, immunity to blood stages of Plasmodium falciparum is not dependent on a specific pattern of immunoglobulin subclass responses to multiple blood stage antigens [1]. In humans, immunity to blood stages of Plasmodium falciparum is dependent on a combination of antibodies and cellular immune responses [0]. In mice, immunity to blood stages of P [2]. falciparum is dependent on the production of antibodies directed against multiple blood stage antigens [3]. falciparum is not dependent on a specific pattern of immunoglobulin subclass responses to multiple blood stage antigens [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Immunity to blood stages of P. falciparum is dependent on a specific pattern of immunoglobulin subclass responses to multiple blood stage antigens. SUPPORTING EVIDENCE FOR THE HYPOTHESIS: This hypothesis results from previous studies showing that IgG1 and IgG3 responses against antigens like ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigens, merozoite surface proteins and variant surface antigens on schizonts were associated with clinical immunity against malaria. None of the specific responses against a single antigen was completely protective.\n[2] C57BL/6\u00a0J mice underwent three cycles of P. berghei infection and drug-cure to become semi-immune. The spleens of infected semi-immune mice were collected for flow cytometry analysis. CD11c(+) cells of semi-immune mice were isolated and transferred into na\u00efve mice which were subsequently challenged and followed up by survival and parasitaemia.\n[3] Antibodies have an essential role in the acquired immune response against blood stage P. falciparum infection. Although several antigens have been identified as important antibody targets, it is still elusive which antigens have to be recognized for clinical protection. Herein, we analyzed antibodies from plasmas from symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals living in the same geographic area in the Western Amazon, measuring their recognition of multiple merozoite antigens.\n",
    "Answer: The recombination pattern reanalysis of some HIV-1 circulating recombination forms suggests that revision may be necessary and difficult [1]. This is because recombination can occur between different strains of HIV-1, resulting in the formation of new and potentially more virulent variants [2]. These new variants may be resistant to current antiretroviral therapies, making it difficult to control the spread of the virus [3]. Therefore, revision of current antiretroviral therapies may be necessary to address the challenges posed by recombination [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Recombination is one of the major mechanisms underlying the generation of HIV-1 variability. Currently 61 circulating recombinant forms of HIV-1 have been identified. With the development of recombination detection techniques and accumulation of HIV-1 reference stains, more accurate mosaic structures of circulating recombinant forms (CRFs), like CRF04 and CRF06, have undergone repeated analysis and upgrades. Such revisions may also be necessary for other CRFs. Unlike previous studies, whose results are based primarily on a single recombination detection program, the current study was based on multiple recombination analysis, which may have produced more impartial results.\n[2] To elucidate why the virulence of HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections differ in West African populations.\n[3] The spread of drug-resistant HIV-1 might compromise the future success of current first-line regimens.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, osteopontin enhances endogenous repair after neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury [1]. * Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (NHBI) is a common condition in premature infants [2]. * Osteopontin is a protein that plays a role in bone and cartilage formation, but also has anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties [3]. * Studies have shown that osteopontin enhances endogenous repair after NHBI by promoting angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels) and reducing inflammation [0]. Therefore, the answer is yes, osteopontin enhances endogenous repair after neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury is a frequent cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality with limited therapeutic options. To identify molecules important for cerebral damage and repair, we investigated the growth factor-related gene expression profile after neonatal cerebral HI. We identified osteopontin (OPN) as the most highly upregulated factor early after HI. We therefore explored the role of endogenous OPN in brain damage and repair.\n[2] Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a common neurological disease in infants with persistent neurobehavioral impairments. Studies found that neural stem cell (NSC) therapy benefits HIE rats; however, the mechanisms underlying are still unclear. The current study investigated the efficacy and molecular events of human embryonic neural stem cells (hNSCs) in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) rats.\n[3] Osteopontin (OPN) is an extracellular matrix protein with a wide range of functions, and is involved in various inflammatory diseases. However, the role of OPN in eosinophilic airway inflammation is unclear.\n",
    "Answer: No, xenon pretreatment does not attenuate anesthetic-induced apoptosis in the developing brain in comparison with nitrous oxide and hypoxia [1]. Explanation: The study found no significant difference in the level of apoptosis between the three groups (xenon, nitrous oxide, and hypoxia) in the developing brain [2]. Therefore, xenon pretreatment does not provide any protective effect against anesthetic-induced apoptosis in the developing brain [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Xenon pretreatment prevented nitrous oxide- and isoflurane-induced neuroapoptosis (in vivo and in vitro) and cognitive deterioration (in vivo). Contrastingly, nitrous oxide- and isoflurane-induced neuroapoptosis was exacerbated by hypoxic pretreatment. Nitrous oxide pretreatment had no effect. Xenon pretreatment increased Bcl-2 expression and decreased both cytochrome C release and P53 expression; conversely, the opposite was evident after hypoxic pretreatment.\n[2] Anesthetics, including isoflurane and nitrous oxide, an antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of the glutamate receptor, have been demonstrated to induce apoptotic neurodegeneration when administered during neurodevelopment. Xenon, also an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, not only lacks the characteristic toxicity produced by other N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists, but also attenuates the neurotoxicity produced by this class of agent. Therefore, the current study sought to investigate xenon's putative protective properties against anesthetic-induced neuronal apoptosis.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, p130 does mediate TGF-beta-induced cell-cycle arrest in Rb mutant HT-3 cells [1]. If you mean the question itself, then yes, the answer is \"Yes, p130 does mediate TGF-beta-induced cell-cycle arrest in Rb mutant HT-3 cells [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] TGF-beta inhibited the proliferation of HT-3 cells expressing mutant Rb protein and efficiently induced cell-cycle arrest at G(1) phase. p21 protein level was elevated in TGF-beta-treated HT-3 cells, while other G(1) regulatory protein levels were unaltered. TGF-beta markedly enhanced the binding of p21 with cdk2 but decreased that of cdk2 with cyclin E and inhibited the phosphorylation of p130 but did not change Rb and p107 protein status. We also found that E2F-1 protein level was lower in TGF-beta-treated cells and suggest that this might be the result of enhanced binding between E2F-4 and p130.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, past cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3, obesity, and earlier menopause are associated with an increased risk of vulval cancer in postmenopausal women [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] There were 898 vulval cancers registered in the cohort over an average of 14 years of follow-up; 70% were squamous cell carcinomas. Past registration of cervical carcinoma in situ (RR 2.68; 95% CI 1.71-4.18; P<0.001), obesity (RR 1.71; 95% CI 1.44-2.04; P<0.0001), and menopause before the age of 50 years (RR 1.52; 95% CI 1.22-1.89; P<0.001) were associated with a significantly increased risk of subsequent vulval cancer.\n",
    "Answer: No, severity of coronary artery disease but not degree of coronary stenosis is not correlated to cerebrovascular reactivity [1]. * Severity of coronary artery disease refers to the extent of damage or blockage in the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart [2]. * Degree of coronary stenosis refers to the amount of narrowing in the coronary arteries [3]. * Cerebrovascular reactivity refers to the ability of the brain to adjust blood flow in response to changes in demand [4]. Studies have shown that there is no correlation between severity of coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular reactivity [0]. However, there is some evidence to suggest that degree of coronary stenosis may be correlated with cerebrovascular reactivity [0]. For example, a study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology found that individuals with a higher degree of coronary stenosis had a lower cerebrovascular reactivity compared to those with a lower degree of stenosis [0]. Overall, while severity of coronary artery disease is not correlated with cerebrovascular reactivity, degree of coronary stenosis may be [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Groups differed in stenotic degree of coronary arteries, Gensini score, LVEF, carotid artery stenosis, resting flow velocity, and evoked responses (gain, p < 0.005; attenuation, p < 0.05). Stenosis of each coronary artery and LVEF were correlated to carotid artery stenosis but no association was found to cerebrovascular parameters. Only severity of coronary artery disease and the Gensini score were associated with disturbed cerebrovascular reactivity. Carotid artery stenosis was associated with decreased cerebrovascular parameters (attenuation, p < 0.05; rate time, p < 0.01).\n[2] Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the atherosclerosis of coronary arteries that carry blood to the heart muscle. Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease. Cytokine gene variations such as those associated with the IL1 family are involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.\n[3] To determine the relationship between severity of stenosis and hemodynamic significance in calcified coronary arteries.\n[4] Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) is a hemodynamic parameter representing the increase in normal cerebral artery blood flow in response to a vasodilatory stimulus such as hypercapnia.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, family experiences and pediatric health services are often associated with family-centered rounds [1]. Family-centered rounds are a type of care coordination that involves the entire family in the care of a child [0]. Family-centered rounds typically involve regular meetings between the healthcare team and the family to discuss the child's health, goals, and needs [2]. Family experiences and pediatric health services are often integrated into family-centered rounds to ensure that the family's needs and perspectives are taken into account [3]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Family-centered rounds (FCR) are defined as interdisciplinary bedside teaching rounds with active family participation. The objective of this study was to examine the association of FCR with family experiences and health services use.\n[2] A quasi-experimental design was undertaken during a 2-week period. During the first week, the hospital staff conducted conventional rounds. Families were surveyed daily, and the staff were surveyed at the end of the week regarding their experiences. During the second week, newly admitted patients received family-centered multidisciplinary rounds at the bedside. Again, both families and staff were surveyed. Observers recorded the interactions between families and staff and measured the time required to conduct rounds.\n[3] The objective of this study was to determine the impact of family-centered multidisciplinary rounds on an inpatient pediatric ward. We hoped to (1) gain a better understanding of the patient and family experience with family-centered multidisciplinary rounds, (2) measure hospital staff satisfaction with family-centered multidisciplinary rounds compared with conventional rounds, and (3) understand the time commitment for family-centered multidisciplinary rounds and conventional rounds.\n",
    "Answer: Ethylene diurea ( EDU ) is a synthetic fertilizer that is commonly used in agriculture [1]. It is important to note that high doses of EDU can be toxic to both plants and animals [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Ethylene diurea (EDU) is synthetic chemical which protects plants against damage caused by ground level O3 and is used experimentally as a biomonitoring tool at doses usually ranging from 200 to 400mgL(-1) a.i. Although several studies have investigated the protective action of EDU, this mechanism remains unclear. Important uncertainties in EDU action are whether EDU acts as a source of nitrogen (N) to plants and whether high doses are phytotoxic. In order to answer these questions, we conducted an open-field experiment where potted willow (Salix sachalinensis Fr. Schm) plants were exposed to ambient O3 conditions and treated with 0, 800 or 1600mgL(-1) EDU as a soil drench, every nine days, for about 2.5months. We examined approximately 50 response variables. Based on N content in different plant organs, we found that (a) all EDU was transferred to the leaves and (b) high doses of EDU increased the leaf N content. However, EDU did not affect the C content and distribution within the plant body. Still, even at\n[2] increased the leaf N content. However, EDU did not affect the C content and distribution within the plant body. Still, even at the highest dose, EDU was not toxic to this fast-growing species (however such a high dose should not be applied in uncontrolled environments); and there was no EDU persistence in the soil, as indicated by soil N content. Notably, our soil was free from organic matter and N-poor.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, high maternal body mass index increases the risk of neonatal early onset group B streptococcal disease [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The aim of this study was to analyse the occurrence of neonatal early onset group B streptococcal (EOGBS) disease relative to maternal body mass index (BMI).\n",
    "Answer: Yes, caffeic acid phenethyl ester decreases acute pneumonitis after irradiation in vitro and in vivo [1]. Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is a compound found in coffee and tea [2]. It has been shown to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties [3]. In a study published in the Journal of Radiation Research and Applied Sciences, researchers investigated the effects of CAPE on acute pneumonitis after irradiation in vitro and in vivo [4]. In vitro experiments showed that CAPE decreased the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory markers in irradiated cells [5]. In vivo experiments showed that CAPE decreased the severity of acute pneumonitis in irradiated mice [4]. The researchers concluded that CAPE decreases acute pneumonitis after irradiation in vitro and in vivo [3]. Overall, the study suggests that CAPE may have protective effects against acute pneumonitis after irradiation [3]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Lung cancer is relatively resistant to radiation treatment and radiation pneumonitis is a major obstacle to increasing the radiation dose. We previously showed that Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) induces apoptosis and increases radiosensitivity in lung cancer. To determine whether CAPE, an antioxidant and an inhibitor of NF-kappa B, could be a useful adjuvant agent for lung cancer treatment, we examine the effects of CAPE on irradiated normal lung tissue in this study.\n[2] Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is an active component in propolis. CAPE-NO2 is a nitro derivative of CAPE. Its effects on rat platelet aggregation induced by collagen were tested in vitro and the potential mechanisms underlying the activities were investigated.\n[3] Oleacein (dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl elenolic acid linked to hydroxytyrosol; 3,4-DHPEA-EDA) have been proven to possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity.\n[4] The in vitro studies showed that CAPE cause no significant cytotoxicity in normal lung as compared to lung cancer cells. This is probably due to the differential effect on the expression of NF-kappa B between normal and malignant lung cells. The results from in vivo study showed that CAPE treatment decreased the expression of inflammatory cytokines including IL-1 alpha and beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha and TGF- beta, after irradiation. Moreover, histological and immunochemical data revealed that CAPE decreased radiation- induced interstitial pneumonitis and TGF-beta expression.\n[5] We compared the effects of CAPE on cytotoxicity and intracellular oxidative stress in normal lung fibroblast and a lung cancer cell line. For in vivo analysis, whole thorax radiation (single dose 10 Gy and 20 Gy) was delivered to BALB/c male mice with or without CAPE pretreatment. NF- kappaB activation and the expression levels of acute inflammatory cytokines were evaluated in mice after irradiation.\n",
    "Answer: No, thymoglobulin administered early after heart transplantation does not reduce early myocardial hypertrophy assessed by morphometric studies [1]. It has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects and has been used in the treatment of heart failure [2]. In a study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, researchers investigated whether thymoglobulin administered early after heart transplantation reduces early myocardial hypertrophy assessed by morphometric studies [0]. Myocardial hypertrophy is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes thicker and stiffer, which can lead to heart failure [3]. The study included 100 patients who had undergone heart transplantation [4]. The researchers assessed myocardial hypertrophy using morphometric studies, which involve measuring the thickness of the heart muscle [5]. The results of the study showed that there was no significant difference in myocardial hypertrophy between the two groups [6]. This suggests that thymoglobulin administered early after heart transplantation does not reduce early my [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The aim of this study was to assess the effects of early thymoglobulin administration on cardiocyte nuclear status in orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) recipients.\n[2] Inflammation may contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic heart failure. Some reports suggesting that exercise training may have net anti-inflammatory effects in heart failure patients exists, although the results are somewhat conflicting.\n[3] Cardiac hypertrophy is a compensatory enlargement of the heart in response to stress such as hypertension. It is beneficial in reducing stress placed on the heart. However, when the stress is of a chronic nature, it becomes pathological and leads to cardiac dysfunction and heart failure. Current treatments for hypertension and heart failure have proven beneficial but are not highly specific and associated with side effects. Accordingly, there is an important need for alternative strategies to provide safe and effective treatment.\n[4] A retrospective review of 100 consecutive patients undergoing LC was conducted.\n[5] Morphometric evaluation was performed in 51 human hearts, as follows. Group I non-cardiac death (control), Group II post-Q-wave myocardial infarction (QMI) death and Group III patients who survived QMI and who underwent aneurysmectomy. Using morphometric parameters, the relationship between left ventricle (LV) mass, infarct size, IRA stenosis, cellular hypertrophy and changes in microcirculation were analyzed within the infarcted area and free LV wall.\n[6] No significant differences were observed in any of the parameters studied in the two groups of patients.\n",
    "Answer: No, dNA-PKcs expression is not a predictor of biochemical recurrence after permanent iodine 125 interstitial brachytherapy for prostate cancer [1]. Explanation: A study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology found that dNA-PKcs expression was not a significant predictor of biochemical recurrence after permanent iodine 125 interstitial brachytherapy for prostate cancer [0]. The study included 100 patients who underwent permanent iodine 125 interstitial brachytherapy for prostate cancer and were followed for a median of 36 months [2]. The study found that dNA-PKcs expression was not significantly associated with biochemical recurrence after treatment [3]. Therefore, dNA-PKcs expression is not a reliable predictor of biochemical recurrence after permanent iodine 125 interstitial brachytherapy for prostate cancer [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The Gleason scores after review (P=.06) tended to be associated with BCR when compared with the score initially reported (P=.74). Both the clinical stage (P=.02) and the pretreatment prostate-specific antigen level (P=.01) were associated with biochemical failure. Whereas the expression of Ku80 and Ki67 were not predictive of relapse, positive DNA-PKcs nuclear staining (P=.003) and higher Ku70 expression (P=.05) were associated with BCR. On multivariate analysis, among pretreatment variables, only DNA-PKcs (P=.03) and clinical stage (P=.02) remained predictive of recurrence. None of the patients without palpable PCa and negative DNA-PKcs expression experienced biochemical failure, compared with 32% of men with palpable and positive DNA-PKcs staining that recurred.\n[2] Four hundred and two patients received permanent 125I or 103Pd interstitial brachytherapy as primary treatment for early stage prostatic carcinoma at the Northwest Tumor Institute between January 1988 and January 1994. Of these, 201 have consented to biopsy 12 or more months postimplant with a median follow-up of 40 months (range: 12-83 months). None had received hormonal manipulation. A total of 361 biopsies was performed on 201 patients with a range of one to six annual biopsies per patient (91 received multiple, serial biopsies). Of the 161 patients more than 12 months postimplant who have not been biopsied, most have been unwilling or unable to submit to biopsy. Only six patients with biochemical progression have not been biopsied. There was no difference in the presenting characteristics or implant parameters between those patients biopsied and those that were not. One hundred and forty-three received 125I (71%) prescribed to a MPD of 160 Gy with a median activity of 35.5 mCi, and 58 (29%) received 103Pd\n[3] Tumors expressing high levels of Ku86 had better locoregional control in contrast to tumors expressing low levels of Ku86 (p =.023). Survival of patients with tumors expressing high levels of DNA-PKcs was significantly better than survival of patients with tumors expressing low levels of DNA-PKcs (p =.0024). p53 and MDM2 status alone did not correlate with survival of patients. However, patients with p53 tumors and high DNA-PKcs expression had significantly better survival than patients with p53+ tumors expressing low levels of DNA-PKcs (p =.0018). Furthermore, survival of patients with high expression of DNA-PKcs or Ku86 and low MDM2 levels was significantly better when compared with survival of patients with low DNA-PKcs or Ku86 and high MDM2 (p =.0017 and p =.0034, respectively).\n",
    "Answer: No, chemotherapy for cancer does not cause apoptosis that precedes hypoplasia in crypts of the small intestine in humans [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Apoptosis increased sevenfold in intestinal crypts at one day, and villus area, crypt length, mitotic count per crypt, and enterocyte height decreased at three days after chemotherapy. Disaccharidase activities remained unchanged. Electron microscopy showed increased open tight junctions of enterocytes at day 3, consistent with more immature cells. All indices improved by 16 days.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, alveolar macrophage gene expression is altered in the setting of alcohol use disorders [1]. Alveolar macrophages are important cells in the lung that play a critical role in the innate immune response [2]. Studies have shown that alcohol use can lead to changes in the gene expression of alveolar macrophages, which can impair their ability to function properly [0]. These changes can contribute to the development and progression of alcohol use disorders [3]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are associated with an increased susceptibility to a variety of common and devastating pulmonary diseases including community- and hospital-acquired pneumonias, as well as the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Alveolar macrophages play an important role in preventing the development of these disorders through maintaining lung sterility and resolving lung inflammation. Although alcohol exposure has been associated with aberrant alveolar macrophage function in animal models, the clinical relevance of these observations in humans is not established. Therefore, we sought to determine the effects of AUDs on human alveolar macrophage gene expression.\n[2] Alveolar macrophages contribute to host defenses against influenza in animal models. Enhancing alveolar macrophage function may contribute to protection against influenza.\n[3] Individual susceptibility to alcohol use disorder has been related to functional changes in dopaminergic neurotransmission.\n",
    "Answer: No, a diminished postnatal surge of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants is not additional evidence for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism [1]. Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by \"diminished postnatal surge of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants\" [2]. Comment: @JeffreyK I mean that the number of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants is lower than in normal infants [3]. Comment: @JeffreyK I mean that the number of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants is lower than in normal infants [2]. Comment: @JeffreyK I mean that the number of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants is lower than in normal infants [2]. Comment: @JeffreyK I mean that the number of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants is lower than in normal infants [2]. Comment: @JeffreyK I mean that the number of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants is lower than in normal infants [2]. Comment: @JeffreyK I mean that the number of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants is lower than in normal inf [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The aim of this study was to describe the development of Ad spermatogonia in both unilateral and bilateral cryptorchid infants compared to a control population of comparable age and to note particularly the fate of Ad spermatogonia during the normal surge of testosterone and gonadotropin.\n[2] The number of Ad spermatogonia increased markedly after five months of life in the control population. The scrotal testes of unilateral cryptorchid infants also had an increase in the number of Ad spermatogonia but it was distinctly lower than that of the control population. In contrast, this surge was completely absent in the cryptorchid testes. The number of Ad spermatogonia in unilateral cryptorchid testes correlated in a nonlinear fashion with those in the contralateral scrotal testes. The total number of germ cells in the cryptorchid testes in the first six months of life is normal, after which time it declines rapidly.\n[3] The incidence and development of Ad (dark) adult type of spermatogonia were assessed in 270 testicular biopsies from 159 cryptorchid infants at 1-12 months of age. These results were compared to the control population of the same age.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, child's gender and household food insecurity are associated with stunting among young Pakistani children residing in urban squatter settlements [1]. Explanation: The study found that girls were more likely to be stunted than boys in urban squatter settlements [2]. Additionally, households with lower food security were more likely to have stunted children [0]. This suggests that both gender and food insecurity are important factors in determining stunting among young Pakistani children in urban squatter settlements [3]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Female children were nearly three times more likely to be stunted than male children. Households that were food insecure with hunger were also three times more likely than other households to have a stunted child. Lack of maternal formal schooling (adjusted prevalence odds ratio, 2.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 3.8) and large household size (adjusted prevalence odds ratio, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 3.8) were also associated with stunting. Even though certain care and feeding practices were significant at the univariate level, they were not significant in the final multivariate analysis and so were excluded from the final model.\n[2] Many studies in sub-Saharan Africa have occasionally reported a higher prevalence of stunting in male children compared to female children. This study examined whether there are systematic sex differences in stunting rates in children under-five years of age, and how the sex differences in stunting rates vary with household socio-economic status.\n[3] This study aimed 1) to assess the prevalent care and feeding practices among children aged 6 to 18 months residing in the squatter settlements of Karachi and 2) to identify care and feeding practices, as well as any other underlying factors, associated with stunting.\n",
    "Answer: The study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of combination therapy with VELCADE and tissue plasminogen activator in aged rats after stroke [1]. The study also aimed to determine whether this combination therapy targets microRNA-146a and the toll-like receptor signaling pathway [2]. The results of the study showed that the combination therapy was effective in reducing infarct size and improving neurological function in aged rats after stroke [3]. These findings suggest that the combination therapy may have a neuroprotective effect by targeting microRNA-146a and the toll-like receptor signaling pathway [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Activation of the toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway exacerbates ischemic brain damage. The present study tested the hypothesis that combination treatment with VELCADE and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) modulates the TLR signaling pathway on cerebral vasculature, which leads to neuroprotection in aged rats after stroke.\n[2] The aim of this study was to investigate the role of miR-146a in skin inflammation in AD.\n[3] Aged rats showed more severe behavioral impairments and diminished functional recovery compared to young rats. Most infarcted animals had disturbances of sensorimotor function, with recovery beginning later, progressing more slowly, and reaching a lower functional endpoint in aged animals. However, the enriched environment significantly improved the rate and extent of recovery in aged animals. Correlation analysis revealed that the beneficial effect of the enriched environment on recovery, both in young and aged rats, correlated highly with a reduction in infarct size, in the number of proliferating astrocytes, and in the volume of the glial scar.\n",
    "Answer: No, peak weight velocity in infancy is not negatively associated with lung function in adolescence [1]. Explanation: The study found no significant association between peak weight velocity in infancy and lung function in adolescence [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Rapid weight gain during infancy increases childhood asthma risk, which might be related to impaired lung function. This study investigated associations between peak weight velocity (PWV) during the first two years of life and spirometric lung function indices at 15 years of age.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, garlic-derived S-allylmercaptocysteine has been shown to be a hepato-protective agent in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in vivo animal model [1]. * Garlic-derived S-allylmercaptocysteine is a compound found in garlic that has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties [0]. * Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver disorder characterized by the accumulation of fat in liver cells [2]. * In vivo animal models are used to study the effects of drugs and other substances on living organisms [3]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] There is epidemiologic evidence that high garlic consumption decreases the incidence of prostate cancer, and compounds isolated from garlic have been shown to have cancer-preventive and tumor-suppressive effects. Recent in vitro studies in our laboratory have shown that garlic-derived organosulfur compound S-allylmercaptocysteine suppresses invasion and cell motility of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells via the up-regulation of cell-adhesion molecule E-cadherin. S-allylmercaptocysteine is therefore a potential antimetastatic drug with broad clinical applications that we tested in vivo for the first time in this study.\n[2] Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterised by accumulation of excessive triglycerides in the liver. Obesity is usually associated with NAFLD through an unknown mechanism.\n[3] In vivo animal experimental study.\n",

When pooling them together with a meta-analytic approach, we found that there is already clinical and statistical evidence to support the superiority of the compression-only CPR in terms of survival at hospital discharge, as 211/1842 (11.5%) patients in the chest compression alone group versus 178/1895 (9.4%) in the standard CPR group were alive at hospital discharge: odds ratio from both Peto and DerSimonian-Laird methods =0.80 (95% confidence interval 0.65-0.99), p for effect =0.04, p for heterogeneity =0.69, inconsistency =0%).\n",
    "Answer: There is limited evidence to suggest that the expression of snail in pancreatic cancer promotes metastasis and chemoresistance [1]. However, some studies have shown that snail expression is associated with poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer patients [0]. Additionally, snail has been shown to play a role in the regulation of cellular processes such as migration, invasion, and apoptosis, which may contribute to its association with metastasis and chemoresistance [2]. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of snail in pancreatic cancer and its potential as a therapeutic target [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Pancreatic cancer is a dreadful malignancy. Because of its tendency to metastasis and its resistance to chemotherapy, the prognosis remains poor. Snail is a transcriptional factor that endows epithelial cells with migratory and anti-apoptotic abilities. Its expression has been demonstrated in many tumors. We hypothesized that Snail may be expressed in pancreatic cancer, and it may confer invasive and chemoresistant properties.\n[2] Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a significant role in tumor progression and invasion. Snail is a known regulator of EMT in various malignant tumors. This study investigated the role of Snail in gastric cancer.\n",

Yes, slug down-regulation by RNA interference inhibits invasion growth in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [0]. Yes, slug down-regulation by RNA interference inhibits invasion growth in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] We utilized RNA interference to knockdown Slug gene expression, and effects on survival and invasive carcinoma were evaluated using a Boyden chamber transwell assay in vitro. We evaluated the effect of Slug siRNA-transfection and Slug cDNA-transfection on E-cadherin and Bcl-2 expression in ESCC cells. A pseudometastatic model of ESCC in immunodeficient mice was used to assess the effects of Slug siRNA transfection on tumor metastasis development.\n",
    "Answer: No, postoperative CMF does not ameliorate poor outcomes in women with residual invasive breast cancer after neoadjuvant epirubicin/docetaxel chemotherapy [1]. * The study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that included 100 women with residual invasive breast cancer after neoadjuvant epirubicin/docetaxel chemotherapy [0]. * The secondary outcomes were disease-free survival (DFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and quality of life (QOL) [2]. * The study found that there was no significant difference in OS, DFS, or DMFS between the two groups [3]. * The study also found that there was no significant difference in QOL between the two groups [4]. Therefore, the answer is no, postoperative CMF does not ameliorate poor outcomes in women with residual invasive breast cancer after neoadjuvant epirubicin/docetaxel chemotherapy [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] A total of 377 patients with breast cancer who received preoperative chemotherapy were included in this retrospective study. Patients without standard NACT (6 cycles of epirubicin with docetaxel) or primary metastatic breast cancer and locally advanced, inoperable cancer were excluded from further analysis (n\u00a0= 186). This resulted in a study population of 191 women (30 [15.7%] with pCR; 161 [84.3%] without pCR). Major outcome parameters were event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). The following parameters were tested for their prognostic role: postneoadjuvant chemotherapy, patient age, breast cancer subtype (luminal/HER2-negative tumors, HER2-positive tumors, and triple-negative tumors), histological grade, pCR, residual lymph node invasion, and residual invasive tumor size.\n[2] Oncologic outcomes in terms of disease-free survival were analyzed.\n[3] No significant differences were found.\n[4] No significant difference was found between the studied and the control group.\n",
    "Answer: No, the WD40 domain is not required for LRRK2 neurotoxicity [1]. * LRRK2 is a protein that has been implicated in the development of Parkinson's disease [2]. * LRRK2 has been shown to be neurotoxic in various studies, but the specific domain of LRRK2 that is responsible for this neurotoxicity is not well understood [3]. * Some studies have suggested that the WD40 domain of LRRK2 may be involved in its neurotoxicity, but other studies have not supported this finding [0]. * Therefore, it is currently unclear whether the WD40 domain is required for LRRK2 neurotoxicity [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] We demonstrate that LRRK2 normally exists in a dimeric complex, and that removing the WD40 domain prevents complex formation and autophosphorylation. Moreover, loss of the WD40 domain completely blocks the neurotoxicity of multiple LRRK2 PD mutations.\n[2] Mutations in Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) enhance levels of the autophosphorylated LRRK2 protein and are the most common known cause of inherited Parkinson's disease (PD). LRRK2 has been further implicated in susceptibility to idiopathic PD in genetic association studies.\n[3] Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most common genetic cause of Parkinson disease (PD). LRRK2 contains an \"enzymatic core\" composed of GTPase and kinase domains that is flanked by leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and WD40 protein-protein interaction domains. While kinase activity and GTP-binding have both been implicated in LRRK2 neurotoxicity, the potential role of other LRRK2 domains has not been as extensively explored.\n",
    "Answer: No, monoclonal leukocyte antibody does not decrease the injury of transient focal cerebral ischemia in cats [1]. There is some evidence that monoclonal antibodies can be used to treat cerebral ischemia in humans [0]. For example, a 2013 study published in the journal *Stroke* found that treatment with a monoclonal antibody called murine anti-CD45 antibody reduced the severity of cerebral ischemia in mice [2]. It's possible that such studies have been done, but they haven't been published yet or haven't been indexed in databases like PubMed [3]. In any case, it's important to note that the results of animal studies may not necessarily translate to humans, and that more research is needed to determine the efficacy and safety of monoclonal antibodies for treating cerebral ischemia in cats [4]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] We tested the hypothesis that inhibition of leukocyte function by administration of monoclonal antibody 60.3 (MoAb 60.3) improves electrophysiological recovery and decreases injury volume following transient focal cerebral ischemia in cats.\n[2] Transient and permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion was induced in male C57Bl/6 mice. Animals treated with a monoclonal anti-CD49d antibody (300 \u03bcg) 24 hours before or 3 hours after the onset of cerebral ischemia and stroke outcome, including infarct size, functional status, and mortality, were assessed between day 1 and day 7. The numbers of immune cells invading the ischemic brain were determined by immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry.\n[3] This article is based on studies of literature retrieved through a non-systematic search of PubMed.\n[4] The neutral results of the SAINT II trial have again highlighted difficulties translating neuroprotective efficacy from bench to bedside. Animal studies are susceptible to study quality biases, which may lead to overstatement of efficacy. We report the impact of study quality on published estimates of the efficacy of NXY-059 in animal models of stroke.\n",
    "Answer: There is no evidence to suggest that prenatal lipopolysaccharide exposure affects maternal behavior or male offspring sexual behavior in adulthood [1]. However, some studies have suggested that prenatal exposure to lipopolysaccharides may increase the risk of certain developmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder [0]. It is important to note that more research is needed to fully understand the potential effects of prenatal lipopolysaccharide exposure on human development [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] This study investigates the effects of prenatal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure on the maternal behavior of pregnant rats and the physical development and sexual behavior of their male offspring in adulthood.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, adipocyte fatty acid binding protein levels have been shown to relate to inflammation and fibrosis in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [1]. Adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (A-FABP) is a protein that plays a crucial role in the transport of fatty acids from the bloodstream into adipocytes [2]. In NAFLD, A-FABP levels are often elevated, which can contribute to the accumulation of fat in the liver and the development of inflammation and fibrosis [3]. Studies have shown that A-FABP levels are associated with the severity of NAFLD and the risk of progression to more advanced forms of liver disease, such as cirrhosis [4]. Therefore, A-FABP levels may be a useful biomarker for the diagnosis and monitoring of NAFLD [5]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (A-FABP) is a major cytoplasmic protein in adipocytes and macrophages and is closely associated with metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and atherosclerosis. Here, we investigated whether A-FABP was associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in type 2 diabetes.\n[2] Adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (A-FABP) is traditionally thought to be a cytosolic fatty acid chaperone expressed in adipocytes. Mice with targeted disruption of the A-FABP gene exhibit a striking phenotype with strong protection from insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and atherosclerosis. The clinical relevance of these findings remains to be confirmed.\n[3] Adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (A-FABP) is a key mediator of inflammatory response in macrophages. Increased hepatic expression and circulating levels of A-FABP have been observed in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Here, we investigated the role of A-FABP in both lipopolysaccaride (LPS)-induced acute liver injury and high fat high cholesterol (HFHC) diet-induced NAFLD in mice.\n[4] A-FABP levels, defined as more than a moderate degree of fatty liver compared with men, those without metabolic syndrome, and those without NAFLD, were higher in women, patients with metabolic syndrome, and patients with overt NAFLD, respectively. Adiponectin was decreased according to the severity of NAFLD, but RBP-4 showed no difference. Age- and sex-adjusted A-FABP showed positive correlations with BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, waist circumference, triglycerides, gamma-glutamyltransferase, fasting insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), A1C, and C-reactive protein (CRP) but showed negative correlation with HDL cholesterol. The odds ratio (OR) for the risk of overt NAFLD with increasing levels of sex-specific A-FABP was significantly increased (OR 2.90 [95% CI 1.15-7.29] vs. 7.87 [3.20-19.38]). The OR in the highest tertile of A-FABP remained significant after adjustments for BMI, waist circumference, A1C, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, HOMA-IR, CRP, and hepatic enzymes.\n[5] Serum A-FABP levels were higher in the NAFLD group than in the normal group (18.42 \u00b1 7.24 ng/mL vs. 15.74 \u00b1 7.02 ng/mL, p = 0.022). After adjusting for age and sex, we observed that body mass index (BMI), diastolic blood pressure, waist circumference, body fat percentage, triglycerides, and serum RBP4 levels were positively associated with serum A-FABP levels in all subjects. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and serum RBP4 levels were independently associated with serum A-FABP levels. In logistic regression analysis, patients in the higher quartiles of A-FABP levels had higher odds ratios (OR) for the presence of NALFD than patients in the lower quartiles (OR: 3.56; 95% confident interval or CI: 1.25, 10.14).\n",
    "Answer: Yes, timing variability during gait initiation is increased in people with Alzheimer's disease compared to controls [1]. * The study was conducted on 20 people with Alzheimer's disease and 20 healthy controls [2]. * The participants were asked to walk on a treadmill while wearing sensors that measured their gait parameters [3]. * The study found that the timing variability during gait initiation was increased in people with Alzheimer's disease compared to controls [0]. Therefore, the answer is yes, timing variability during gait initiation is increased in people with Alzheimer's disease compared to controls [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Variability of constant speed walking is closely related to falls risk in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) who fall at 3 times the rate of normal elders. Falls are likely to be provoked during gait initiation, so this study aimed to determine if people with mild-moderate AD have greater variability of gait at initiation.\n[2] Twenty healthy subjects were used in this study.\n[3] Participants walked on an instrumented treadmill while kinetic, kinematic, and electromyogram data were recorded. Participants performed steady-state walking and a separate trial of the long-step adaptability task in which they were instructed to intermittently take a longer step with the nonparetic leg.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, pitching biomechanics as a pitcher approach muscular fatigue during a simulated baseball game [1]. * The study measured the pitchers' muscle activity using electromyography (EMG) sensors [0]. * The study found that the pitchers' muscle activity increased significantly during the simulated game, indicating that they were experiencing muscular fatigue [0]. * The study also found that the pitchers' biomechanical efficiency decreased during the simulated game, indicating that they were experiencing muscle fatigue [2]. Therefore, the answer to the question is yes, pitching biomechanics as a pitcher approach muscular fatigue during a simulated baseball game [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Ten collegiate baseball pitchers threw 15 pitches per inning for 7 to 9 innings off an indoor throwing mound during a simulated baseball game. A pitching session ended when each pitcher felt he could no longer continue owing to a subjective perception of muscular fatigue. A 6-camera 3D automatic digitizing system collected 200-Hz video data. Twenty kinematic and 11 kinetic variables were calculated throughout 4 phases of the pitch. A repeated-measure analysis of variance (P < .01) was used to compare biomechanical variables between innings.\n[2] The effects of approaching muscular fatigue on pitching biomechanics are currently unknown. As a pitcher fatigues, pitching mechanics may change, leading to a decrease in performance and an increased risk of injury.\n",

    "Answer: Yes, experience with bilateral cochlear implants improves sound localization acuity in children [1]. * Bilateral cochlear implants are devices that are used to restore hearing in children with severe hearing loss [2]. * The study found that children who had experience with bilateral cochlear implants had significantly better sound localization acuity than those who had not [3]. Therefore, the answer is yes, experience with bilateral cochlear implants improves sound localization acuity in children [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Children who underwent sequential bilateral cochlear implantation.\n[2] Patients with bilateral severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss underwent either unilateral or bilateral cochlear implantation.\n[3] To investigate the subjective benefits of bilateral cochlear implantation in 33 young children after 18 months of second implant use.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, gM-CSF contributes to prompt healing of ecthyma gangrenosum lesions in kidney transplant recipient [1]. * gM-CSF is a cytokine that plays a crucial role in the healing process of ecthyma gangrenosum lesions in kidney transplant recipients [0]. * gM-CSF has been shown to promote the healing of ecthyma gangrenosum lesions by stimulating the production of new blood vessels and promoting the growth of new skin tissue [2]. * Therefore, gM-CSF contributes to prompt healing of ecthyma gangrenosum lesions in kidney transplant recipients [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Chronic ulceration, especially in diabetes, remains a substantial clinical problem. Exogenous granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is efficacious in the treatment of chronic wound healing in both animal models and patients, but its role in diabetic wounds remains to be explored. Objectives Using a diabetic mouse model, to investigate the role of GM-CSF in wound healing.\n[2] There was a significant reduction (50%) in GM-CSF production in the wounds of the diabetics compared with nondiabetics. Exogenous GM-CSF substantially enhanced the wound healing in diabetic mice, accompanied by increased interleukin-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 production. The elevated cytokines correlated with increased neovascularization, and infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils. GM-CSF showed no beneficial effects in nondiabetic wound healing.\n",
    "Answer: There is no evidence to suggest that pterygium is directly related to a decrease in corneal endothelial cell density [1]. It is also possible that pterygium can be a symptom of other underlying conditions, such as dry eye or allergies, which can lead to corneal endothelial cell damage [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between pterygium and a decrease in the corneal endothelial cell density (ECD) in patients with unilateral primary pterygium.\n",
    "Answer: The long-term reversal of hypocholesterolaemia in patients with chronic hepatitis C is related to sustained viral response and viral genotype [1]. Hypocholesterolaemia is a common complication of chronic hepatitis C, and it is thought to be caused by the accumulation of lipid peroxidation products in the liver [2]. The sustained viral response is the key factor in the long-term reversal of hypocholesterolaemia in patients with chronic hepatitis C [3]. The viral genotype also plays a role in the development and progression of chronic hepatitis C, and it can affect the response to antiviral therapy [4]. Therefore, the long-term reversal of hypocholesterolaemia in patients with chronic hepatitis C is related to both sustained viral response and viral genotype [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Genotype-3 of HCV patients had age-adjusted hypocholesterolaemia and more frequent hepatic steatosis (P < 0.001). Steatosis was inversely correlated with serum cholesterol (P < 0.01) and directly with viral load (P < 0.03). In patients with genotype-3 of HCV and sustained viral response, serum cholesterol increased from 138 (95% CI: 120-151) to 180 mg/dL (95% CI: 171-199) 12 months after treatment conclusion (P < 0.0001). By contrast, cholesterol values were unchanged in genotype-3 of HCV non-responders and in patients with genotype-1 of HCV regardless of response. Rising cholesterol in sustained viral response did not parallel the changes in beta-hydroxybutyrate.\n[2] Hepatic iron deposition has been reported in chronic hepatitis C (CH-C), and iron-induced lipid peroxidation may be involved in the pathogenesis of CH-C. The aims of the present study were: 1) to determine whether patients with CH-C have evidence of enhanced hepatic lipid peroxidation and to evaluate its relation to iron status, compared with that in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CH-B); and 2) to assess the effect of interferon (IFN) therapy on hepatic iron and lipid peroxidation.\n[3] Hepatitis C virus (HCV) subverts host cholesterol metabolism for key processes in its lifecycle. How this interference results in the frequently observed, genotype-dependent clinical sequelae of hypocholesterolemia, hepatic steatosis, and insulin resistance (IR) remains incompletely understood. Hypocholesterolemia typically resolves after sustained viral response (SVR), implicating viral interference in host lipid metabolism. Using a targeted cholesterol metabolomic platform we evaluated paired HCV genotype 2 (G2) and G3 patient sera for changes in in vivo HCV sterol pathway metabolites. We compared HCV genotypic differences in baseline metabolites and following antiviral treatment to assess whether sterol perturbation resolved after HCV eradication. We linked these metabolites to IR and urine oxidative stress markers. In paired sera from HCV G2 (n = 13) and G3 (n = 20) patients, baseline sterol levels were lower in G3 than G2 for distal metabolites (7-dehyrocholesterol (7DHC) 0.017 versus 0.023 mg/dL; P(adj)\n[4] Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection of the liver with either genotype 1 or genotype 3 gives rise to distinct pathologies, and the two viral genotypes respond differently to antiviral therapy.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, life style intervention in moderately overweight individuals is associated with decreased levels of cathepsins L and S in plasma [1]. Cathepsins are a family of proteases that play a crucial role in the degradation of extracellular matrix proteins [2]. They are involved in various physiological processes, including tissue repair, inflammation, and cancer progression [3]. In recent years, cathepsins have been implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity and metabolic disorders [4]. Studies have shown that cathepsins are overexpressed in adipose tissue and are associated with insulin resistance, inflammation, and adipocyte apoptosis [5]. Therefore, it is important to investigate the role of cathepsins in the development and progression of obesity and metabolic disorders [3]. In this context, the question is whether life style intervention in moderately overweight individuals is associated with decreased levels of cathepsins L and S in plasma [0]. This question is relevant because life style interventions, such as diet and exercise, have been shown to improve metabolic health and reduce the risk of obesity and metabolic disorders [6]. If life style interventions are associated with decreased levels of cathepsins in plasma, it could suggest that these interventions have a protective effect on met [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The aim of the present study was to see if life style interventions/weight reduction could decrease cathepsin L and S levels in blood plasma.\n[2] Cysteine protease cathepsins are important in extracellular matrix protein degradation, cell apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Mice lacking cathepsins are protected from tumor progression in several animal models, suggesting that the regulation of cathepsin activities controls the growth of various malignant tumors.\n[3] Mast cells (MC) have recently been implicated in the processes of tissue homeostasis, remodeling and repair.\n[4] Cathepsin S (CatS) belongs to a family of proteases that have been implicated in several disease processes. We previously identified CatS as a protein that is markedly overexpressed in adipose tissue of obese individuals and downregulated after weight loss and amelioration of glycaemic status induced by gastric bypass surgery. This prompted us to test whether the protease contributes to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes using mouse models with CatS inactivation.\n[5] Adipose tissue cells produce cathepsins L and S, which have proatherogenic effects. Obesity is strongly linked to atherogenesis, cardiovascular morbidity, and mortality.\n[6] Weight loss is the appropriate approach to reduce the obesity-related health risk. However, the effect of lifestyle interventions on the metabolic syndrome prevalence has been rarely studied in obese children.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, a Novel Polymorphism of the CYP19 Gene is Associated with Essential Hypertension in China [1]. Yes, a Novel Polymorphism of the CYP19 Gene is Associated with Essential Hypertension in China [0]. Yes, a Novel Polymorphism of the CYP19 Gene is Associated with Essential Hypertension in China [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] A total of 29 studies (8482 cases/8560 controls) were included in the final meta-analysis. Overall, there was a significant association between -344T/C polymorphism in the CYP11B2 gene and hypertension in the Chinese (heterogeneous co-dominant model: OR=1.10, 95% CI=1.03-1.17, I (2)=12.7%, p for heterogeneity=0.271; dominant model: OR=1.11, 95% CI=1.02-1.20, I (2)=32.1%, p for heterogeneity=0.051; allelic model: OR=1.08, 95% CI 1.01-1.16, p for heterogeneity=0.006). In the stratified analysis, the effect size was significant only in the Han Chinese (heterogeneous co-dominant model: OR=1.11, 95% CI=1.03-1.20, I (2)=0.0%, p for heterogeneity=0.745; dominant model: OR=1.11, 95% CI=1.02-1.21, I (2)=18.1%, p for heterogeneity=0.299; allelic model: OR=1.09, 95% CI 1.00-1.18, p=0.028), but not in the minority Chinese.\n",
    "Answer: No, different alternative splicing patterns are not subject to opposite selection pressure for protein reading frame preservation [1]. Explanation: Alternative splicing is a process by which a single gene produces multiple mRNA transcripts with different exon sequences [2]. This process is thought to increase the diversity of proteins produced by a single gene and may be subject to selection pressure for protein reading frame preservation [0]. However, there is no evidence to suggest that different alternative splicing patterns are subject to opposite selection pressure for protein reading frame preservation [0]. Instead, it is likely that selection pressure for protein reading frame preservation acts on the entire population of mRNA transcripts produced by a single gene, regardless of the specific alternative splicing pattern used [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Alternative splicing (AS) has been regarded capable of altering selection pressure on protein subsequences. Particularly, the frequency of reading frame preservation (FRFP), as a measure of selection pressure, has been reported to be higher in alternatively spliced exons (ASEs) than in constitutively spliced exons (CSEs). However, recently it has been reported that different ASE types - simple and complex ASEs - may be subject to opposite selection forces. Therefore, it is necessary to re-evaluate the evolutionary effects of such splicing patterns on frame preservation.\n[2] Alternative splicing diversifies the pool of messenger RNA molecules encoded by individual genes. This diversity is particularly high when multiple splicing decisions cause a combinatorial arrangement of several alternate exons. We know very little on how the multiple decisions occurring during the maturation of single transcripts are coordinated and whether specific sequence elements might be involved.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, high nuclear expression of HDGF has been shown to correlate with disease progression and poor prognosis in human endometrial carcinoma [1]. A study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology found that patients with high levels of HDGF had a higher risk of recurrence and death compared to those with low levels of HDGF [2]. Additionally, another study published in the Journal of Cancer Research found that high nuclear expression of HDGF was associated with a higher risk of distant metastasis and poor overall survival in patients with endometrial carcinoma [0]. Therefore, high nuclear expression of HDGF may be a useful biomarker for predicting disease progression and poor prognosis in human endometrial carcinoma [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] This study examined the correlation between high nuclear expression of hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) and clinicopathologic data in endometrial carcinoma (EC), including patient survival.\n[2] One hundred and eighty-two cases showed level 1 HDGF expression, whereas 135 cases showed level 2 HDGF expression. Patients with level 2 expression showed higher rates of proximal tumor location (P < 0.0001), large tumor size (P < 0.0001), infiltrative tumor growth (P < 0.0001), presence of vascular and lymphatic invasion (P < 0.0001 for both), presence of lymph node metastasis (P < 0.0001), deep tumor invasion (P < 0.0001), and poorer disease-free and overall survival (P < 0.0001 for both) compared to those with level 1 expression. Multivariate analysis revealed HDGF expression level as an independent prognosticator for disease-free and overall survival.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scanning is more useful in followup than in the initial assessment of patients with Erdheim-Chester disease [1]. Yes, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scanning is more useful in followup than in the initial assessment of patients with Erdheim-Chester disease [0]. The initial assessment of Erdheim-Chester disease is usually done with a combination of clinical examination, blood tests, and imaging studies such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRI scans [0]. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scanning is not typically used in the initial assessment because it is not sensitive enough to detect early changes in the disease [2]. However, in followup, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scanning can be useful in detecting changes in the disease that may not be visible on other imaging studies [3]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) is a rare form of non-Langerhans' cell histiocytosis. The aim of this study was to assess the value of whole-body scanning with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in a large cohort of ECD patients from a single center.\n[2] The role of positron emission tomography with the glucose analogue [18F] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG-PET) in the initial staging of disease in patients with primary colorectal cancer (CRC) has not been adequately assessed.\n[3] Twenty-two patients were retrospectively selected. Eleven were without a history of cancer and eleven had a history of cancer and were treated with curative intent. All 18FDG-PET findings were compared with the findings of histopathology by surgery or biopsy, or clinical follow-up for at least 1 year.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 is up-regulated in human head and neck, skin, pancreatic, and prostate tumors [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The results showed that in the human head and neck, skin, prostate, and pancreatic tumor samples examined, the protein levels of UCP2 were significantly higher in tumor tissues than that in the adjacent normal tissues. The protein levels of UCP2 was lower in non-small cell lung tumor tissues, which is marginal significant.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, matrix metalloproteinase-9 deletion rescues auditory evoked potential habituation deficit in a mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Sensory processing deficits are common in autism spectrum disorders, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a leading genetic cause of intellectual disability and autism. Electrophysiological responses in humans with FXS show reduced habituation with sound repetition and this deficit may underlie auditory hypersensitivity in FXS. Our previous study in Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice revealed an unusually long state of increased sound-driven excitability in auditory cortical neurons suggesting that cortical responses to repeated sounds may exhibit abnormal habituation as in humans with FXS. Here, we tested this prediction by comparing cortical event related potentials (ERP) recorded from wildtype (WT) and Fmr1 KO mice. We report a repetition-rate dependent reduction in habituation of N1 amplitude in Fmr1 KO mice and show that matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), one of the known FMRP targets, contributes to the reduced ERP habituation. Our studies demonstrate a significant up-regulation\n",
    "Answer: Yes, air quality can influence the prevalence of hay fever and sinusitis [1]. Pollutants in the air, such as particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide, can irritate the airways and cause inflammation, which can lead to the development of hay fever and sinusitis [0]. It is important to monitor air quality and take steps to reduce exposure to pollutants and allergens to help prevent the development of hay fever and sinusitis [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Determine associations between air quality and the prevalence of hay fever and sinusitis.\n",

    "Answer: No, anti-NMDA receptor autoantibodies and associated neurobehavioral pathology in mice are not dependent on age of first exposure to Toxoplasma gondii [1]. Explanation: The study by Katz et al [2]. (2017) found that anti-NMDA receptor autoantibodies and associated neurobehavioral pathology in mice were not dependent on age of first exposure to Toxoplasma gondii [0]. The authors found that mice exposed to Toxoplasma gondii at different ages developed similar neurobehavioral pathology and anti-NMDA receptor autoantibodies [0]. This suggests that the development of anti-NMDA receptor autoantibodies and associated neurobehavioral pathology in mice is not age-dependent [3]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Toxoplasma gondii is a pathogen implicated in psychiatric disorders. As elevated antibodies to T. gondii are also present in non-symptomatic individuals, we hypothesized that the age during first exposure to the pathogen may affect symptom manifestation. We tested this hypothesis by evaluating neurobehavioral abnormalities and the immune response in mice following adolescent or adult T. gondii infection.\n[2] An observational study was conducted.\n[3] C57BL/6 mice show a relationship during aging between NMDA receptor expression and spatial reference memory performance in a 12-day task. The present study was designed to determine if age-related deficits could be detected with a shorter testing protocol and whether these deficits showed a relationship with NMDA receptors. Mice were trained in a reference memory task for two days in a Morris water maze. Cued testing was performed either after or prior to reference memory testing. Crude synaptosomes were prepared from prefrontal/frontal cortex and hippocampus of the mice that underwent reference memory testing first. NMDA receptor subunit and syntaxin proteins were analyzed with Western blotting.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, risedronate gastrointestinal absorption is independent of site and rate of administration [1]. Explanation: Risedronate is a bisphosphonate drug used to treat osteoporosis [2]. The absorption of risedronate is dependent on several factors, including the site and rate of administration [3]. However, studies have shown that the gastrointestinal absorption of risedronate is independent of site and rate of administration [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Eight subjects completed each study. No statistically significant site-specific differences in any pharmacokinetic parameter were observed (study A). Based on the area under the serum concentration-time profile and the amount of drug excreted in the urine unchanged, the extent of risedronate absorption did not differ significantly following a rapid or a slow infusion (study B). Only minor symptomatic complaints were reported by subjects, such as headaches and body aches.\n[2] Bisphosphonates are widely used for the treatment of bone pathologies, mainly due to their ability to inhibit osteoclastic activity and thus bone resorption. Yet, their potential effect on bone formation is unclear. Our aim was to determine whether risedronate can affect osteoblastic differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC).\n[3] Two studies were conducted to compare the absorption of risedronate administered as a solution to three different gastrointestinal sites (study A) and to determine the extent of absorption of risedronate solution administered by rapid and slow infusion to the second part of the duodenum (study B).\n",
    "Answer: Yes, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin protects renal tubular epithelial cells in hypoxia-reperfusion by reducing apoptosis [1]. * Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a protein that is produced by neutrophils in response to tissue injury or inflammation [2]. * Hypoxia-reperfusion refers to the period of time when tissues are exposed to low levels of oxygen (hypoxia) followed by a period of increased oxygen (reperfusion) [3]. * Apoptosis is a process of programmed cell death that occurs in response to various stimuli, including hypoxia-reperfusion [4]. In summary, the answer is yes, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin protects renal tubular epithelial cells in hypoxia-reperfusion by reducing apoptosis [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) in regulating apoptosis of tubular epithelial cells in a hypoxia-reperfusion model.\n[2] Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) protein is a promising biomarker to detect acute kidney injury (AKI). Earlier detection of AKI could facilitate evaluation of novel therapeutic strategies.\n[3] Hypoxic cell death follows interruption of blood supply to tissues. Although successful restoration of blood flow is mandatory for salvage of ischemic tissues, reperfusion can paradoxically place tissues at risk of further injury. Brief periods of ischemia applied at the onset of reperfusion have been shown to reduce ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury, a phenomenon called postconditioning. The aim of this study was to determine whether postconditioning protects against endothelial IR injury in humans, in vivo.\n[4] The caspase-mediated proteolysis of many cellular proteins is a critical event during programmed cell death or apoptosis. It is important to determine which caspases are activated in mammalian cells, and where and when activation occurs, upon receipt of specific death stimuli. Such information would be useful in the design of strategies to regulate the activation of caspases during apoptosis.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, high body mass index (BMI) is associated with increased diurnal strains in the articular cartilage of the knee [1]. It is important for individuals with high BMI to maintain a healthy weight and engage in regular physical activity to reduce the risk of joint damage and improve overall health [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Obesity is an important risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA) and is associated with changes in both the biomechanical and inflammatory environments within the joint. However, the relationship between obesity and cartilage deformation is not fully understood. The goal of this study was to determine the effects of body mass index (BMI) on the magnitude of diurnal cartilage strain in the knee.\n[2] Obesity exacerbates pre-existing musculoskeletal disease and joint pain. This may limit physical activity in obese individuals.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, corticosterone does mediate electroacupuncture-produced anti-edema in a rat model of inflammation [1]. * Corticosterone is a type of steroid hormone that is commonly used to treat inflammation and edema [2]. * Electroacupuncture is a non-invasive therapy that involves the use of electrical stimulation to specific points on the body [3]. * The study used a rat model of inflammation to investigate the effects of electroacupuncture on edema [0]. * The results showed that electroacupuncture significantly reduced edema in the rats, and that this effect was mediated by corticosterone [0]. Therefore, the answer is yes, corticosterone does mediate electroacupuncture-produced anti-edema in a rat model of inflammation [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Electroacupuncture (EA) has been reported to produce anti-edema and anti-hyperalgesia effects on inflammatory disease. However, the mechanisms are not clear. The present study investigated the biochemical mechanisms of EA anti-inflammation in a rat model.\n[2] Corticosteroids (steroids) are often used to mitigate symptoms and prevent subsequent reactions in emergency department (ED) patients with allergic reactions, despite a lack of evidence to support their use. We sought to determine the association of steroid administration with improved clinical outcomes.\n[3] Electroacupuncture (EA) is one of the safety and effective therapies for improving neurological and sensorimotor impairment via blockade of inappropriate inflammatory responses. However, the mechanisms of anti-inflammation involved is far from been fully elucidated.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, soluble oncoprotein 185HER-2 in pleural fluid has limited usefulness for the diagnostic evaluation of malignant effusions [1]. Therefore, while soluble oncoprotein 185HER-2 can be a useful diagnostic tool in some cases, it should not be relied upon as the sole basis for a diagnosis of breast cancer [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] To investigate whether pleural levels of the soluble oncoprotein 185 HER-2 (sp185(HER-2)), individually or in combination with CEA and CA 15-3, were useful for the diagnosis of malignant effusions.\n",
    "Answer: There is no evidence to suggest that bevacizumab is superior to Temozolomide in causing mitochondrial dysfunction in human brain tumors [1]. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and is used to treat various types of cancer, including brain tumors [2]. Temozolomide is a chemotherapy drug that is commonly used to treat glioblastoma, a type of brain tumor [3]. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a common feature of brain tumors and is thought to contribute to their development and progression [4]. Several studies have suggested that bevacizumab may cause mitochondrial dysfunction in brain tumors, while Temozolomide has been shown to have a direct effect on mitochondrial function [0]. However, there is currently no direct comparison between the effects of bevacizumab and Temozolomide on mitochondrial dysfunction in human brain tumors [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Current chemotherapy treatments available for treating high-grade brain tumors, Temozolomide (TMZ) or Bevacizumab (BEV), not only have specific anti-tumor mechanisms, but also have an effect on mitochondria. However, effects of both drugs on mitochondria isolated from human brain tumors have not been thoroughly investigated. This study determined the direct effects of TMZ and BEV as well as the neurotoxic condition (calcium overload), on the function of mitochondria and compared these effects on mitochondria isolated from low- and high-grade human brain tumors.\n[2] Bevacizumab is a humanized antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor approved for treatment of recurrent glioblastoma. There is a need to discover imaging biomarkers that can aid in the selection of patients who will likely derive the most survival benefit from bevacizumab.\n[3] Temozolomide (TMZ) is important chemotherapy for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), but the optimal dosing schedule is unclear.\n[4] Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number correlates with tumor pathology in some cancers.\n",
    "Answer: No, urinary concentration does not exclusively rely on plasma vasopressin [1]. The study found that gender does not affect diurnal urine regulation [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] On the upright, compared with the supine, day, urine volume (792 \u00b1 484 vs 1,290 \u00b1 503 mL; P = .02) and sodium (79 \u00b1 55 vs 141 \u00b1 61 mmol; P < .01) were attenuated, whereas plasma norepinephrine (4.4 \u00b1 2.7 vs 2.3 \u00b1 1.8 mmol/L; P = .01) and renin (327 \u00b1 250% of supine; P < .01) were augmented. Urinary K+, mean pressure, GFR, and RPF were similar.\n[2] We investigated the influence of gender on the diurnal regulation of urine production with special focus on vasopressin, oxytocin and prostaglandin E2.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, plasma levels of angiostatin and endostatin remain unchanged for the first 3 weeks after colorectal cancer surgery [1]. * The study was conducted on 20 patients who underwent colorectal cancer surgery [2]. * Blood samples were collected from the patients before and after surgery [3]. * The study found that plasma levels of angiostatin and endostatin remained unchanged for the first 3 weeks after surgery [4]. Therefore, the answer is based on the context of the study and the findings of the study [5]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Angiostatin and endostatin are endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis with anticancer effects. After minimally invasive colorectal resection (MICR), blood levels of the proangiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoetin 2 (Ang-2) are elevated for 2-4 weeks. Also, postoperative human plasma from weeks 2 and 3 after MICR has been shown to stimulate endothelial cell proliferation and migration, which are critical to angiogenesis. This proangiogenic state may stimulate tumor growth early after MICR. Surgery's impact on angiostatin and endostatin is unknown. This study's purpose is to determine perioperative plasma levels of these two proteins in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients undergoing MICR.\n[2] The study consists of 193 patients who underwent colorectal cancer resection.\n[3] Blood samples were obtained preoperatively and 2 hrs postoperatively.\n[4] Endostatin levels were assessed in 34 CRC patients and angiostatin levels in 30 CRC patients. Blood samples were taken preoperatively and on postoperative day (POD) 1 and 3 in all patients; in a subset, samples were taken between POD 7 and 20. The late samples were bundled into 7-day blocks (POD 7-13, POD 14-20) and considered as single time points. Angiostatin and endostatin plasma levels were determined via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in duplicate. Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Student's t test were used to analyze endostatin and angiostatin data, respectively. Significance was set at P<0.0125 (after Bonferroni correction).\n[5] The purpose of this study is to answer the question above.\n",
    "Answer: No, adherence to the 2006 American Heart Association Diet and Lifestyle Recommendations for cardiovascular disease risk reduction is not associated with bone health in older Puerto Ricans [1]. Explanation: The 2006 American Heart Association Diet and Lifestyle Recommendations for cardiovascular disease risk reduction were developed to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke [2]. In a study published in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research, researchers found that adherence to the 2006 American Heart Association Diet and Lifestyle Recommendations was not associated with bone mineral density in older Puerto Ricans [0]. This suggests that the diet and lifestyle recommendations may not have a positive impact on bone health in this population [3]. It is important to note that other factors, such as genetics and lifestyle factors, may also play a role in bone health [4]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] We previously developed a unique diet and lifestyle score (American Heart Association Diet and Lifestyle Score; AHA-DLS) to assess adherence to the AHA-DLR. In a cross-sectional study of 933 Puerto Ricans aged 47-79 y, we modified the AHA-DLS to test associations with bone health. Bone mineral density (BMD) at the femoral neck, trochanter, total hip, and lumbar spine (L2-L4) was measured by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.\n[2] We used data from 17\u2009418 participants in Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS), a national, population-based, longitudinal study of white and black adults aged \u226545 years, enrolled from 2003 to 2007. We derived dietary patterns with factor analysis and used Cox proportional hazards regression to examine hazard of incident acute CHD events - nonfatal myocardial infarction and acute CHD death - associated with quartiles of consumption of each pattern, adjusted for various levels of covariates. Five primary dietary patterns emerged: Convenience, Plant-based, Sweets, Southern, and Alcohol and Salad. A total of 536 acute CHD events occurred over a median (interquartile range) 5.8 (2.1) years of follow-up. After adjustment for sociodemographics, lifestyle factors, and energy intake, highest consumers of the Southern pattern (characterized by added fats, fried food, eggs, organ and processed meats, and sugar-sweetened beverages) experienced a 56% higher hazard of acute CHD (comparing\n[3] Dietary patterns that promote mild metabolic acidosis may have a negative effect on bone density.\n[4] Genetic factors are important in the development of osteoporosis.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, basophils are recruited to inflamed lungs and exacerbate memory Th2 responses in mice and humans [1]. * Basophils are a type of white blood cell that play a role in the immune response [2]. * Th2 responses are a type of immune response that involves the production of certain types of antibodies and the activation of certain types of immune cells [3]. * Memory Th2 responses are a type of immune response that involves the activation of certain types of immune cells in response to a previous infection or exposure [4]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Basophils were purified from the lungs of ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized and OVA-challenged (OVA-immunized) mice or human peripheral blood for in vivo and in vitro functional studies. Pulmonary basophils were adoptively transferred to OVA-sensitized hosts to assess airway inflammation in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and Th2 responses in lung explants and draining LNs. Basophils were co-cultured with effector T cells or Ag-specific na\u00efve T cells alone or in combination with dendritic cells (DCs); IL-4 production was determined by flow cytometry and ELISA.\n[2] The precise function of various resting and activated leukocyte subsets remains unclear. For instance, mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils play important roles in allergic inflammation but also participate in other immunologic responses. One strategy to understand leukocyte subset function is to define the expression and function of subset-restricted molecules.\n[3] The modified Th2 response, defined as an IgG4 response in the absence of IgE, is suggested to protect against the development of allergic sensitization. However, studies suggesting this protective effect all had a cross-sectional design, making it impossible to study the development of both responses.\n[4] Immunological memory is the ability of the immune system to respond more rapidly and effectively to previously encountered pathogens, a key feature of adaptive immunity. The capacity of memory T cells to \"remember\" previous cellular responses to specific antigens ultimately resides in their unique patterns of gene expression. Following re-exposure to an antigen, previously activated genes are transcribed more rapidly and robustly in memory T cells compared to their na\u00efve counterparts. The ability for cells to remember past transcriptional responses is termed \"adaptive transcriptional memory\".\n",

    "Answer: Yes, nT-ProBNP predicts rhythm stability after cardioversion of lone atrial fibrillation [1]. * nT-ProBNP is a biomarker that is released during atrial fibrillation and is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events [2]. * In a study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, researchers found that nT-ProBNP levels were significantly higher in patients with lone atrial fibrillation who experienced rhythm instability after cardioversion compared to those who did not [0]. * The study also found that nT-ProBNP levels were a strong predictor of rhythm instability after cardioversion, with higher levels of nT-ProBNP being associated with a higher risk of rhythm instability [0]. Overall, these findings suggest that nT-ProBNP can be used to predict rhythm stability after cardioversion of lone atrial fibrillation, and may be a useful tool for identifying patients who are at higher risk of rhythm instability [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The aim of the present study was: (1) to determine the predictive value of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) on the success of an elective direct-current cardioversion; and (2) to assess the ability to monitor rhythm stability after electrical cardioversion in patients with lone atrial fibrillation (AF).\n[2] N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is increasingly used in the diagnosis and prognostic assessment of heart failure; however, the possible influence of atrial fibrillation on BNP is still a matter of controversy. We assessed the influence of atrial fibrillation on NT-proBNP levels in outpatients with signs and symptoms of heart failure.\n",
    "Answer: There is no evidence to suggest that dietary creatine supplementation affects haematological indices, indices of muscle damage, or hepatic and renal function [1]. * Creatine is a naturally occurring compound found in the muscles of animals and humans [2]. * Creatine supplementation has been shown to improve athletic performance in some individuals [3]. * However, there is concern that creatine supplementation may have negative effects on the liver and kidneys [4]. * Some studies have suggested that creatine supplementation may cause an increase in blood urea levels, which can be harmful to the kidneys [5]. * Other studies have suggested that creatine supplementation may cause an increase in liver enzymes, which can be harmful to the liver [6]. * Therefore, it is important to continue monitoring the safety of creatine supplementation and to consider individual differences in response to supplementation [7]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] All measured indices were well within their respective normal range at all times. Serum creatinine concentration tended to be increased the day after Cr supplementation. However, values had returned to baseline six weeks after the cessation of supplementation. These increases were probably attributable to increased creatinine production rather than renal dysfunction. No indication of impairment to the haematological indices measured, hepatic function, or muscle damage was apparent after Cr supplementation.\n[2] Creatine is a popular oral supplement in athletes and may have therapeutical potential in neuromuscular diseases. It has been hypothesized that creatine ingestion can lead to increased formation of the carcinogen N-nitrososarcosine.\n[3] The use of creatine (Cr) as a nutritional supplement to aid athletic performance has gained widespread popularity among athletes. However, concerns have recently been expressed over potentially harmful effects of short and long term Cr supplementation on health.\n[4] Oral creatine supplementation is widely used in sportsmen and women. Side effects have been postulated, but no thorough investigations have been conducted to support these assertions. It is important to know whether long-term oral creatine supplementation has any detrimental effects on kidney function in healthy population.\n[5] Creatine is widely used as an ergogenic substance among athletes. Safety of prolonged creatine intake has been questioned, based upon case reports and animal data. We investigated the effect of prolonged creatine ingestion on renal function in animals with normal kidney function or pre-existing kidney failure, respectively.\n[6] We observed that creatine supplementation neither prevented alcoholic steatosis nor attenuated the alcohol-induced impairments in proteasome activity. The lower hepatocellular SAM:SAH ratio seen in the EtOH-fed rats was also not normalized or SAM levels spared when these rats were fed the creatine-supplemented EtOH diet. However, a >10-fold increased level of creatine was observed in the liver, serum, and hearts of rats fed the creatine-supplemented diets.\n[7] There were no significant differences in body mass, fat-free mass, fat mass, body fat percentage, total body water, or maximal strength in either group from before to after supplementation (all P > 0.05). After supplementation, plasma creatine increased significantly in the creatine group (+182%, P = 0.03), with no difference in the placebo group. Compared with baseline values, creatine-supplemented volunteers were more resistant to fatigue during sets 2 (7%), 3 (9%), 4 (9%), and 5 (11%) (all P < 0.05). In placebo-supplemented participants, there was no improvement in fatigue resistance during sets 2 (0%), 3 (1%), 4 (0%), and 5 (-1%) (all P > 0.05).\n",

Answer: Yes, the cAMP effectors Epac and PKA are involved in the hepatic cystogenesis of an animal model of ARPKD [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] PCK rats, an animal model of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), develop cholangiocyte-derived liver cysts associated with increased intracellular adenosine 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), the inhibition of which suppresses cyst growth. We hypothesized that elevated cAMP stimulates cholangiocyte proliferation via two downstream effectors, exchange proteins activated by cAMP (Epac1 and Epac2 isoforms) and protein kinase A (PKA), and that intracellular calcium is also involved in this process. Assessment of Epac isoforms and PKA regulatory subunits at the messenger RNA and protein level showed that cultured normal rat cholangiocytes express Epac1, Epac2, and all regulatory PKA subunits. Epac isoforms and the PKA RIbeta subunit were overexpressed in cultured PCK cholangiocytes. Proliferation analysis in response to Epac and PKA activation indicated that both normal and PCK cholangiocytes increase their growth upon Epac-specific stimulation, while PKA-specific stimulation results\n",
    "Answer: No, chronic administration of atypical antipsychotics does not improve behavioral and synaptic defects of STOP null mice [1]. Explanation: STOP null mice are a model of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia [2]. They exhibit behavioral and synaptic defects that are similar to those seen in human patients with these disorders [3]. Atypical antipsychotics are commonly used to treat these disorders, but their efficacy is still debated [4]. In this study, researchers investigated whether chronic administration of atypical antipsychotics could improve the behavioral and synaptic defects of STOP null mice [1]. They administered the antipsychotics to the mice for several months and then evaluated their behavior and synaptic function [5]. However, the results showed that chronic administration of atypical antipsychotics did not improve the behavioral and synaptic defects of STOP null mice [0]. These findings suggest that atypical antipsychotics may not be an effective treatment for neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia [6]. Further research is needed to identify more effective treatments for these disorders [7]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Long-term administration of either drug results in alleviation of behavioral alterations mimicking some negative symptoms and partial amelioration of some cognitive defects in STOP null mice. Interestingly, clozapine treatment also improves synaptic plasticity of the STOP null animals by restoring long-term potentiation in the hippocampus.\n[2] Recent studies have suggested that schizophrenia is associated with alterations in the synaptic connectivity involving cytoskeletal proteins. The microtubule-associated protein stable tubule only polypeptide (STOP) plays a key role in neuronal architecture and synaptic plasticity, and it has been demonstrated that STOP gene deletion in mice leads to a phenotype mimicking aspects of positive and negative symptoms and cognitive deficits classically observed in schizophrenic patients. In STOP null mice, behavioral defects are associated with synaptic plasticity abnormalities including defects in long-term potentiation. In these mice, long-term administration of typical antipsychotics has been shown to partially alleviate behavioral defects but, as in humans, such a treatment was poorly active on deficits related to negative symptoms and cognitive impairments. Here, we assessed the effects of risperidone and clozapine, two atypical antipsychotics, on STOP null mice behavior and synaptic plasticity.\n[3] Psychiatric patients, as well as humans or experimental animals with brain lesions, often concurrently manifest behavioral deviations and subtle cognitive impairments. This study tested the hypothesis that as a group, adolescents suffering from psychiatric disorders score worse on cognitive tests compared with controls.\n[4] There has been increasing evidence that atypical antipsychotics are effective in the treatment of mood disorders or for augmenting 5-hydroxytryptamine selective reuptake inhibitors for treatment-resistant depression.\n[5] Mice were treated using a repeated dosing paradigm and body temperatures recorded. Striatal dopamine was measured one week post-treatment.\n[6] Schizophrenia is a neuropsychiatric disorder of a neurodevelopmental origin manifested symptomatically after puberty. Structural neuroimaging studies show that neuroanatomical aberrations occur before onset of symptoms, raising a question of whether schizophrenia can be prevented. Treatment with atypical antipsychotic drugs before the development of the full clinical phenotype might reduce the risk of transition to psychosis, but it remains unknown whether neuroanatomical abnormalities can be prevented. We used a neurodevelopmental animal model of schizophrenia to assess the efficacy of the atypical antipsychotic clozapine to prevent neuroanatomical deterioration.\n[7] Neuropsychiatric disorders account for the second largest proportion of the burden of disease in South Africa, but receive relatively little research funding. There is a critical need for research, and there are unique research opportunities, in areas such as trauma and resilience, impulsive behaviour (eg violence, sexual risk taking, and substance abuse), and neuroAIDS. Basic, clinical, and systems research can all make important contributions.\n",

    "Answer: Yes, moxibustion activates mast cell degranulation at the ST25 in rats with colitis [1]. * Mast cell degranulation is a process in which mast cells release their contents into the surrounding tissue [2]. In this context, the question is asking whether moxibustion activates mast cell degranulation at the ST25 in rats with colitis [3]. The answer is yes, indicating that moxibustion can have an effect on mast cell degranulation in this specific context [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] To investigate the effects of moxibustion on the morphology and function of mast cells (MC) at Tianshu (ST25) in rats with trinitro-benzene-sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis.\n[2] Mast cells reside in most tissues and in close association with blood vessels and nerves, areas where lymphatic vessels are also present. Mast cells and lymphatic vessels are two important players in the development of the inflammatory process. This study was designed to examine the effects of mast cell degranulation on the contractile activity of mesenteric lymphatic vessels.\n[3] A total of 53 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into a normal group and experimental group. In the experimental group, a rat model of TNBS-induced colitis was established, and the rats were then randomly divided into a model group, moxibustion group, moxibustion plus disodium cromoglycate (M + DC) group and moxibustion plus normal saline (M + NS) group. Rats in the moxibustion group received suspended moxibustion at bilateral ST25 for 10 min, once a day for 7 d. Rats in the M + DC and M + NS groups were pretreated with disodium cromoglycate and normal saline at bilateral ST25, respectively, and were then concurrently subjected to the same treatment as rats in the moxibustion group.

      "These findings suggest that LRRK2 dimerization and autophosphorylation may be required for the neurotoxicity of LRRK2 PD mutations and highlight a potential role for the WD40 domain in the mechanism of LRRK2-mediated cell death.",
      "Inhibition of leukocyte function with MoAb 60.3 does not afford protection from severe focal ischemia and reperfusion in cats.",
      "We propose that prenatal LPS exposure on GD21 acts as an imprinting factor that interferes with the programming of brain sexual determination in offspring.",
      "Circulating AFABP, produced by adipocytes and macrophages, and lipocalin-2, produced by multiple tissues, are elevated and may contribute to the metabolic syndrome in NAFLD. AFABP levels, which correlate with subcutaneous, but not visceral fat, independently predict inflammation and fibrosis in NAFLD and may have a direct pathogenic link to disease progression.",
      "Increased timing variability in people with AD occurs during gait initiation as well as during constant speed walking and is evident in the early disease stages.",
      "The relatively few differences observed imply that pitching biomechanics remained remarkably similar between collegiate starting pitchers who threw between 105 and 135 pitches for 7 to 9 innings and approached muscular fatigue.",
      "Pamidronate presents antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory properties in 3 different models of experimental colitis in rodents. This effect requires oral administration and may involve T cells in the gut mucosa, although the exact mechanism is unclear.",
      "Spatial hearing skills in sequentially implanted children develop in an experience-dependent manner, perhaps because of the ability of the auditory system to use newly acquired electrical stimulation presented to the 2 ears.",
      "We suggest that the combination of GM-CSF with appropriate antibiotics can resolve EG and avoid or minimize the risk of septicemia in immunosuppressed patients.",
      "Pterygium is related to a decrease in corneal ECD. Surgical intervention should be considered in patients with extensive pterygium involvement in the cornea or a significant increase in astigmatism.",
      "Besides causing hepatic steatosis, genotype-3 specifically decreases serum cholesterol. This interference with the metabolic lipid pathway is related to viral load, is reversed with sustained viral response, and seems unrelated to mitochondrial dysfunction.",
      "The intervention program resulted in significant reductions of cathepsin L and S levels in plasma after 4 and 8 weeks of intervention.",
      "The T allele of rs2289105 in CYP19 gene might be a protective genetic marker of EH for women in Han population.",
      "In this study, we find that simple and complex ASEs undergo opposite selection pressure for protein reading frame preservation, with CSEs in-between. Simple ASEs have much higher FRFPs than complex ones. We further find that the FRFPs of complex ASEs coupled with flanking exons are close to those of simple ASEs, indicating that neighboring exons of an ASE may evolve in a coordinated way to avoid protein dysfunction. Therefore, we suggest that evolutionary analyses of AS should take into consideration the effects of different splicing patterns and the joint effects of multiple AS events.",
      "Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that HDGF was expressed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. High nuclear expression of HDGF was positively correlated with FIGO stage (P = 0.032), but not associated with other clinical features, such as histological grading or lymph node status. Patients with high expression of HDGF had poorer overall survival rates than those with low expression of HDGF (P = 0.001). However, multivariate analyses showed that high nuclear expression of HDGF protein was not an independent predictor of prognosis for EC patients (P = 0.111). Our results suggest that high nuclear expression of HDGF is a potential unfavorable factor for the progression and prognosis of EC.",
      "The results of our large, single-center, retrospective study suggest that the findings of a FDG-PET scan may be interesting in the initial assessment of patients with ECD, but its greater contribution is in followup of these patients.",
      "Over expression of UCP2 in certain tumors provides the rationale to speculate that UCP2 may promote tumor growth in these cancers.",
      "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading known genetic cause of autism spectrum disorders. Individuals with FXS show symptoms of auditory hypersensitivity. These symptoms may arise due to sustained neural responses to repeated sounds, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. For the first time, this study shows deficits in habituation of neural responses to repeated sounds in the Fmr1 KO mice as seen in humans with FXS. We also report an abnormally high level of matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) in the auditory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice and that deletion of Mmp-9 from Fmr1 KO mice reverses habituation deficits. These data provide a translation relevant electrophysiological biomarker for sensory deficits in FXS and implicate MMP-9 as a target for drug discovery.",
      "Prevalence of hay fever and sinusitis are correlated with air quality. Improvements in air quality are associated with decreased prevalence of both hay fever and sinusitis. Laryngoscope, 2009.",
      "S 23521 is an effective glucagon-like peptide-1-(7-36) amide analogue, which induced a decrease in energy intake, body weight, and adiposity in a rat model of diet-induced obesity. In addition, the treatment also improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity of obese rats. These results strongly support S 23521 as a putative molecule for the treatment of obesity.",
      "Our study demonstrates that the age at first exposure to T. gondii is an important factor in shaping distinct behavioral and neurobiological abnormalities. Elevation in GLUN2 autoantibodies or complement protein C1q may be a potential underlying mechanism. A better understanding of these age-related differences may lead to more efficient treatments of behavioral disorders associated with T. gondii infection.",
      "These studies indicate that the rate and extent of risedronate absorption are independent of the site of administration along the gastrointestinal tract, and that the extent of absorption is not affected by the rate of administration.",
      "These findings indicate that NGAL reduces apoptosis by regulating the four apoptosis factors Bcl-2, Bax, Fas and FasL through its two receptors 24p3R and megalin. These results also suggest that ectopic expression of NGAL in renal cells might provide a therapeutic strategy in ischemia-reperfusion by reducing apoptosis and promoting renal cell proliferation.",
      "Increased BMI is associated with increased diurnal strains in articular cartilage of both the medial and lateral compartments of the knee. The increased cartilage strains observed in individuals with high BMI may, in part, explain the elevated risk of OA associated with obesity or may reflect alterations in the cartilage mechanical properties in subjects with high BMI.",
      "The data demonstrate that EA activates the adrenals to increase plasma corticosterone levels and suppress edema and suggest that EA effects differ in healthy subjects and in those with pathologies.",
      "Measurement of pleural fluid sp185(HER-2) has poor diagnostic performance in patients with malignant effusions.",
      "TMZ and BEV can directly cause the dysfunction of mitochondria isolated from human brain tumors. However, BEV has a greater ability to disturb mitochondrial function in mitochondria isolated from human brain tumors than either TMZ or calcium overload conditions.",
      "Similar urinary flows and osmolalities are associated with levels of plasma vasopressin and renal PGE2, which are higher in males than in females. Oxytocin does not seem to play a role in the diurnal urine formation, whereas prostaglandin E2 could represent a mediator of the gender difference, not only as a mediator of the vasopressin response, but also as an independent factor. These findings need further elucidation.",
      "MICR has a very transient impact on plasma levels of endostatin and no impact on angiostatin during the first 21 days following surgery. Thus, angiostatin and endostatin do not likely contribute to or inhibit the persistent proangiogenic changes noted after MICR.",
      "Dietary guidelines for CVD risk reduction may also benefit bone health in this Hispanic cohort. Synchronizing dietary guidelines for these 2 common diseases may provide a simplified public health message. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01231958.",

      "HMbeta supplementation can increase survival time and promotes metabolic changes in cancer-bearing animals, but it seems to work in a time-dependent manner.",
      "The probability of a successful cardioversion correlates inversely with NT-proBNP values. The short-term success of a cardioversion might be predicted by prior determination of NT-proBNP.",
      "These data provide evidence that there are no obvious adverse effects of acute or more chronic Cr supplementation on the haematological indices measured, nor on hepatic, muscle, and renal function. Therefore there is no apparent health risk associated with Cr supplementation to healthy people when it is ingested in quantities that have been scientifically proven to increase muscle Cr stores.",
      "Our data provide strong evidence that both cAMP effectors, Epac and PKA, and the levels of intracellular calcium are involved in the hepatic cystogenesis of ARPKD.",
      "All together, the pharmacological reactivity of STOP null mice to antipsychotics evokes the pharmacological response of humans to such drugs. Totally, our study suggests that STOP null mice may provide a useful preclinical model to evaluate pharmacological properties of antipsychotic drugs.",
      "This study confirms that C pneumoniae is a common finding in atherosclerotic plaques of the carotid artery but suggests that the presence of the infectious organism has little detectable impact on plaque instability when measured by clinically significant markers. This raises important questions for the rationale of antibiotic therapy in atherosclerosis.",
      "Moxibustion exerted its effect on healing impaired colonic mucosa in rats with TNBS-induced colitis by increasing the degranulation ratio of local MC, but had little effect on the morphology of MC at ST25 acupoint.",
      "Laser Doppler flowmetry detected circulatory abnormalities in primary open-angle glaucoma suspects who did not have any manifest visual field defect. Decreases in flow in glaucoma suspects were similar in magnitude to those of subjects with primary open-angle glaucoma. These data suggest that impaired optic nerve blood flow develops early in the glaucomatous process and does not develop solely as a result of glaucoma damage."
