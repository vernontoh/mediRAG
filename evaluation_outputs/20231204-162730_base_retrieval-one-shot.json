    "\nAnswer:\nYes, The review discusses and compares different procedures that can be performed after failed angle surgery in pediatric glaucoma. The options include trabeculectomy with or without adjunctive antifibrosis therapy, glaucoma drainage surgery, and cyclodestructive procedures. The review also discusses the success rates and complications of these procedures. The review suggests that the success rate of trabeculectomy is lower among younger patients and that mitomycin C is associated with increased risk of late infectious complications. The review also suggests that glaucoma drainage devices have a success rate approaching 80% at 1 year, but less with longer follow-up. Cyclodestructive procedures are generally reserved for advanced cases, but low-dose cyclodiode therapy and endocyclophotocoagulation may prove useful earlier in the disease (< 2 years).",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, Pamidronate has been shown to improve chemically induced trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid and dextran sulfate sodium colitis in rats and lymphocyte transfer colitis. Pamidronate has no effect on intestinal epithelial cells in vitro in terms of cytokine/chemokine release, but enhances IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, and IL-10 production by T cells in coculture. Pamidronate also exerts a direct immunomodulatory effect on T cells, favoring Th1 differentiation and impairing Th17 polarization.\n\nIn addition, Pamidronate has been shown to have antiinflammatory effects at the cardiovascular level due to inhibition of prenylation, which also probably underlies its therapeutic effects in preclinical models of inflammatory bowel disease. Another inhibitor of prenylation, namely alendronate, has also been shown to reduce colitis in rodents.\n\nOverall, Pamidronate has shown promise as an intestinal antiinflammatory agent in rat and mouse experimental colitis, and further studies are needed to determine its potential therapeutic benefits in humans.",

The study used dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry to measure bone mineral density (BMD) at the femoral neck, trochanter, total hip, and lumbar spine (L2-L4) in 933 Puerto Ricans aged 47-79 y. The results showed that higher adherence to the AHA-DLR was associated with higher BMD at all four sites.

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, basophils accumulate in the lungs of OVA-immunized mice and enhance lung IL-4 and IL-13 release. In vitro studies reveal that basophils interact with lung CD4 effectors to increase T cell survival and Th2 cytokine expression. Human basophils augment in vitro IL-4 expression in effector memory CD4 T cells that include CRTH2(+) cells through IL-4 and TCR-independent pathways. However, the impact of basophils on the function of tissue CD4 effector T cells remains unknown.",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate supplementation affects Walker 256 tumor-bearing rats in a time-dependent manner. In the subcutaneous (Sc) model, beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate supplementation significantly increased the median survival of rats (p<0.0001) and decreased the levels of \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate (p<0.0001) compared to the standard diet (SD) group. In the intraperitoneal (Ip) model, beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate supplementation significantly decreased the bioluminescent signal from the tumor cells (p<0.0001) and increased the median survival of rats (p<0.0001) compared to the SD group. In the ketogenic diet (KD) group, beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate supplementation significantly decreased the levels of \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate (p<0.0001) and increased the median survival of rats (p<0.0001) compared to the lard only (LKD) group.

    "\nAnswer:\nNo, No detrimental effects of creatine supplementation on the haematological indices measured, hepatic function, or muscle damage were apparent after Cr supplementation. In contrast to previous reports, no detrimental effects of creatine supplementation on the renal function indices were observed in two-thirds nephrectomized or sham-operated animals. No differences were observed in inulin (0.28+/-0.08 vs 0.25+/-0.08 ml/min/100 g; P=NS) or creatinine clearance rates. Serum cystatin C concentration, urinary protein excretion, and albumin and urea clearance were comparable between creatine-supplemented and control-diet fed animals in both sham-operated and two-thirds nephrectomized animals. Serum creatine and intramuscular total creatine concentrations were higher in creatine-supplemented groups (P<0.05).",

    "\nAnswer:\nYes, Chlamydia pneumoniae infection has been associated with atherosclerotic plaque instability in patients with established carotid artery stenosis. This association has been observed in studies using molecular biological detection methods and clinically relevant indicators of pathology in carotid artery atheroma. The presence of C pneumoniae correlates with plaque instability, which may increase the risk of atherothrombotic emboli dislodging from an unstable carotid plaque during carotid endarterectomy.\n\nQuestion: Does chlamydia pneumoniae infection influence clinical outcomes in patients with established carotid artery stenosis?\nAnswer:\nIt is unclear whether Chlamydia pneumoniae infection influences clinical outcomes in patients with established carotid artery stenosis. While there is evidence of an association between the presence of C pneumoniae and atherosclerotic plaque instability, it is not clear whether this association has any clinical significance. Further research is needed to clarify the role of C pneumoniae infection in the development and progression of atherosclerotic disease.\n\nQuestion: Does chlamydia pneumoniae infection influence the formation of thrombi at the endarterectomy site after removal of the plaque and restoration of",

      "We conclude that inhibition of TLR4 with eritoran in an in situ murine model significantly reduces MI/R injury and markers of an inflammatory response.",
      "HMbeta supplementation can increase survival time and promotes metabolic changes in cancer-bearing animals, but it seems to work in a time-dependent manner.",
      "The probability of a successful cardioversion correlates inversely with NT-proBNP values. The short-term success of a cardioversion might be predicted by prior determination of NT-proBNP.",
      "These data provide evidence that there are no obvious adverse effects of acute or more chronic Cr supplementation on the haematological indices measured, nor on hepatic, muscle, and renal function. Therefore there is no apparent health risk associated with Cr supplementation to healthy people when it is ingested in quantities that have been scientifically proven to increase muscle Cr stores.",
      "Our data provide strong evidence that both cAMP effectors, Epac and PKA, and the levels of intracellular calcium are involved in the hepatic cystogenesis of ARPKD.",
      "All together, the pharmacological reactivity of STOP null mice to antipsychotics evokes the pharmacological response of humans to such drugs. Totally, our study suggests that STOP null mice may provide a useful preclinical model to evaluate pharmacological properties of antipsychotic drugs.",
      "This study confirms that C pneumoniae is a common finding in atherosclerotic plaques of the carotid artery but suggests that the presence of the infectious organism has little detectable impact on plaque instability when measured by clinically significant markers. This raises important questions for the rationale of antibiotic therapy in atherosclerosis.",
      "Moxibustion exerted its effect on healing impaired colonic mucosa in rats with TNBS-induced colitis by increasing the degranulation ratio of local MC, but had little effect on the morphology of MC at ST25 acupoint.",
      "Laser Doppler flowmetry detected circulatory abnormalities in primary open-angle glaucoma suspects who did not have any manifest visual field defect. Decreases in flow in glaucoma suspects were similar in magnitude to those of subjects with primary open-angle glaucoma. These data suggest that impaired optic nerve blood flow develops early in the glaucomatous process and does not develop solely as a result of glaucoma damage."
