    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the study suggests that soluble ( Pro ) Renin Receptor may play a role in predicting gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The study found that circulating Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) is activated during normal pregnancy, but little is known about RAS in pregnancies complicated by GDM. The study aimed to evaluate the circulating RAS profile in normotensive women with GDM at the third trimester of pregnancy and to compare the results with healthy pregnant and non-pregnant age-matched women. The study found that soluble ( Pro ) Renin Receptor levels were positively associated with \u0394Cr (P<0.05, r=0.159) and inversely associated with \u0394eGFR (P<0.05, r=-0.148) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The study also found that soluble ( Pro ) Renin Receptor levels were inversely associated with \u03b1-Klotho levels (P<0.001, r=-0.174) but did not correlate with prorenin levels. The study suggests that soluble ( Pro ) Renin Receptor may be a useful biomarker for predicting GDM.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, obvious emphysema on computed tomography during an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) is reported to correlate with COPD prognosis. This study aims to study the relationship between prognosis and emphysematous changes on CT during an AECOPD. Histories were recorded, and CT acquired for 106 patients who visited the emergency department for an AECOPD. Emphysematous change was quantified by measuring the percentage of low-attenuation areas (LAA%) in the entire lung on CT images with a threshold of -950 Hounsfield units. Other factors that could influence AECOPD prognosis were also recorded on admission and analysed. At follow ups conducted in 1 year, patient survival, the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnoea Scale, and performance status (PS) were evaluated, and a COPD Assessment Test (CAT) was completed.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, chemokine expression patterns in the systemic and genital tract compartments are associated with HIV-1 infection in women from Benin. The study compares levels of both genital mucosal and blood chemokines between HIV-1-uninfected and HIV-1-infected female commercial sex workers (CSWs) as well as HIV-1-uninfected non-CSW control women at low risk for exposure, recruited in Cotonou, Benin. The study also measures chemokines in breastmilk and infant HIV-1 infection risk in an observational, longitudinal cohort study. The study collected whole blood and in some instances endocervical brush samples from healthy premenopausal and postmenopausal women to determine percentages of HLA-DR(DR)+CD38(38)+CD4+ T cells and HIV-1 chemokine coreceptor expression. The study also determined chemokine, cytokine, and chemokine receptor expression profiles using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization in hilar lymph nodes from cynomolgus macaques at different stages after infection with SIV/DeltaB670.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, pathological observation of lung injury in experimental animals induced by non-ferrous metal ( tin ) dust was conducted. The pathological changes observed in the rat lungs included scattered hoar tip size of the spots in surface and section of the lungs, scattered focal granulomatous inflammation around the small bronchi and dust particles in lung tissue, granulomatous inflammation increase, fibroblasts proliferation, collagen fibers formation and positive VG staining on the 90th day after exposure to tin dusts. Additionally, bronchoalveolar inflammation, simple hyperplasia, papillary hyperplasia and metaplasia of the epithelial cells in alveolar and bronchi, atypical adenomatous hyperplasia and squamous dysplasia were observed, followed by lung cancer in the end. The malignancy rate was significantly different between the experimental group and the three control groups. Lung fibrosis was also found in the experimental group.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the DNA methylation of the retinoid acid receptor beta (RARbeta), cellular retinol-binding protein 1 (CRBP1), and tazarotene-induced gene 1 (TIG1) genes was analyzed in gastric carcinoma (GC) and the expression of these genes was measured by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. In 7 of 8 GC cell lines, the CRBP1 gene was hypermethylated, and CRBP1 transcription was inactive. In 6 of 8 GC cell lines, the TIG1 gene was hypermethylated, and TIG1 transcription was inactive. Treatment with demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restored both CRBP1 and TIG1 transcription. DNA methylation of the RARbeta, CRBP1, and TIG1 genes was detected in 15 of 42 GC samples (36%), 14 of 42 GC samples (33%), and 4 of 42 GC samples (10%), respectively, and in 6 of 30 samples (20%), 0 of 30 samples (0%), and 1 of 30 samples (3%) of corresponding nonneoplastic mucosa.

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, clove and eugenol in noncytotoxic concentrations exert immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory action on cytokine production by murine macrophages. Clove (100\u00b5g/well) inhibited IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-10 production and exerted an efficient action either before or after LPS challenge for all cytokines. Eugenol did not affect IL-1\u03b2 production but inhibited IL-6 and IL-10 production. The action of eugenol (50 or 100\u00b5g/well) on IL-6 production prevented efficiently effects of LPS either before or after its addition, whereas on IL-10 production it counteracted significantly LPS action when added after LPS incubation.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, pretreatment with stellate ganglion blockade before ischemia does not reduce infarct size in rat hearts.

This enhanced clearance was shown to be CD4(+) T-cell dependent.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The role of angiotensin II type 2 (AT(2)) receptor stimulation in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance is still unclear. Therefore, the study is the first to investigate the role of the novel selective AT2R agonist, Compound 21 (C21) in an experimental model of diabetes-associated atherosclerosis (DAA). The study examines the possibility that direct AT(2) receptor stimulation by compound 21 (C21) might contribute to possible insulin-sensitizing/anti-diabetic effects in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) with PPAR\u03b3 activation, mainly focusing on adipose tissue. However, the study does not provide information on whether Compound 21 is protective in experimental diabetes-associated atherosclerosis.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, fitness and adiposity are independently associated with cardiometabolic risk in youth. Several studies have examined the association between fitness and clustered cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in children and adolescents from different countries. For example, a cross-sectional study examined the association between fitness and clustered CVD risk in children and adolescents from three European countries. Similarly, a study in European adolescents participating in the HELENA-CSS (Healthy Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence Cross-Sectional) study examined the independent association of total and central body fat and cardiorespiratory fitness with markers of insulin resistance after controlling for several potential confounders. Additionally, a study in nonobese middle school children defined the relationships between peak aerobic capacity, body composition, and fasting insulin levels. Overall, these studies suggest that fitness and adiposity are independently associated with cardiometabolic risk in youth.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, patient-prosthesis mismatch in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement can affect survival. A study found that moderate or severe prosthesis-patient mismatch was a significant predictor of poorer survival in patients with aortic stenosis, even after adjustment for all significant clinical predictors.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the study found that a high frequency of competitive sports early in life is associated with greater bone mineral density (BMD) at several bone sites, indicating that increases in BMD following physical activity (PA) are preserved longer than previously believed. The study also used quantitative ultrasound (QUS) to measure heel bone quality and quantitative computed tomography (QCT) to assess volumetric BMD, bone geometry and strength at the spine and mid-femur. The results showed that higher sport activity was statistically significantly associated with greater BMD at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip. More home physical activity was associated with higher BMD at the spine and femoral neck. However, work physical activity and active living were not related to BMD at any bone site.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, hemizygous deletion of CTGF/CCN2 does not suffice to prevent fibrosis of the severely injured kidney. The study examined the effects of CCN2 haploinsufficiency on the progression of renal scarring in long-term STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy, in a more advanced stage of obstructive nephropathy following unilateral ureteric obstruction (UUO), and in severe aristolochic acid (AA)-induced tubulotoxic nephritis and found that CCN2 haploinsufficiency did not prevent fibrosis of the severely injured kidney.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The provided context does not directly answer the question about the association between severity of hepatic encephalopathy before liver transplantation and quality of life after transplantation. However, it does mention that hepatic encephalopathy has a negative impact on health-related quality of life (QoL) in liver cirrhosis and that little is known about the effect of previous HE on HRQoL. It also mentions that pretransplant psychosocial evaluations are the norm, but the relationship between psychosocial (and neurocognitive status) and longer term medical outcomes is understudied.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, sutureless securement device, StatLock, has been shown to reduce catheter-related complications when compared to tape in earlier studies. In this study, 170 patients requiring PICCs were randomized to suture or StatLock securement, and patients were followed throughout their entire catheter course. PICC-related complications including dislodgment, infection, occlusion, leakage, and central venous thrombosis were documented. Catheter outcome data were compared to determine if statistically significant differences existed between the suture and StatLock groups. The results showed that StatLock significantly reduced catheter-related complications compared to suture.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, attachment of synovial fibroblasts (SFs) to laminin-111 facilitates transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta)-induced expression of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) in SFs. Incubation of SF on laminin-111 in the presence of TGFbeta induced a significant 12-fold higher expression of MMP-3 mRNA, and secretion of MMP-3 was elevated 20-fold above controls.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, functional health literacy is associated with health status and health-related knowledge in people living with HIV-AIDS. A study conducted on a community-recruited sample of 339 HIV-infected men and women found that patients with inadequate health literacy had lower HIV/AIDS knowledge scores than those with marginal or adequate health literacy. In addition, patients' REALM scores were positively associated with their HIV/AIDS knowledge even after adjusting for income, education, and risk perception. Another study conducted on a sample of 372 patients at an inner-city, public hospital urgent care center found that about 1 of 4 people living with HIV-AIDS demonstrated difficulty comprehending simple medical instructions and therefore lower health literacy. HIV-infected people with lower health literacy had lower CD4 cell counts, higher viral loads, were less likely to be taking antiretroviral medications, reported a greater number of hospitalizations, and reported poorer health than those with higher health literacy. In addition, after adjusting for years of formal education, lower health literacy was associated with poorer knowledge of one's HIV-related health status, poorer AIDS-related disease and treatment knowledge, and more negative health care perceptions and experiences.",

    "\n\nAnswer: The study found no significant differences in family satisfaction between conventional rounds and family-centered multidisciplinary rounds. However, the study did find that family-centered multidisciplinary rounds were associated with better understanding of the patients' medical plans, better ability to help the families, and a greater sense of teamwork among staff compared with conventional rounds. Additionally, the study found that family-centered multidisciplinary rounds required an additional 2.7 minutes per patient during rounds. The study also found that the family affected the medical decision-making discussion in 90% of cases.",
    "\n\nAnswer: High doses of ethylene diurea ( EDU ) were not toxic to the fast-growing willow species, but they did increase the leaf nitrogen content. However, EDU did not affect the carbon content and distribution within the plant body. Additionally, there was no EDU persistence in the soil, as indicated by soil nitrogen content. The study also found that EDU did not act as a nitrogen fertilizer.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, high maternal body mass index (BMI) increases the risk of neonatal early onset group B streptococcal (EOGBS) disease. In obese parturients with BMI > 30, there was an 80% increased risk for verified neonatal EOGBS disease. When cases with clinical sepsis were included, a significant risk increment was also found in overweight women with BMI 25.0-29.9. Additionally, maternal and neonatal fT3 levels consistently increased with increasing maternal obesity, and maternal and neonatal fT3 were significantly correlated. Excess gestational weight gain was associated with a decrease in maternal fT4 compared with gravidae who had insufficient gestational weight gain.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The provided context does mention caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) and its potential to increase radiosensitivity in lung cancer, but it does not specifically discuss its effects on acute pneumonitis after irradiation. Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot determine if CAPE decreases acute pneumonitis after irradiation in vitro and in vivo.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study assessed the effects of early thymoglobulin administration on cardiocyte nuclear status in orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) recipients. The study investigated endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs) from 31 OHT recipients and 10 control cases. OHT patients were divided into the standard group who were treated without thymoglobulin; an ATG group who received thymoglobulin electively, and a standard+ATG group who were administered thymoglobulin upon a drop in renal function. The study evaluated only EMBs obtained at 1 and 4 weeks after OHT showing no significant rejection (ISHLT grades 0 to 1B). The morphometric studies were performed using a computerized, automated Quantimet image analysis system. The study found no significant difference in cardiocyte nuclear area, length, breadth, perimeter, chromatin median grey level, and fullness factor between the standard group, the ATG group, and the standard+ATG group. Therefore, the study did not find that thymoglobulin administered early after heart transplantation reduces early myocardial hypertrophy assessed by morphometric studies.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, dNA-PKcs expression was found to be a predictor of biochemical recurrence after permanent iodine 125 interstitial brachytherapy for prostate cancer. In the study, positive dNA-PKcs nuclear staining was closely associated with biochemical recurrence (P=.0002). On multivariate analysis, only the Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen level, and dNA-PKcs status remained predictive of recurrence (P=.003, P=.002, and P=.01, respectively).",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, according to the provided documents, chemotherapy for cancer can cause apoptosis that precedes hypoplasia in crypts of the small intestine in humans. The first document mentions that apoptosis increased sevenfold in intestinal crypts at one day, and villus area, crypt length, mitotic count per crypt, and enterocyte height decreased at three days after chemotherapy. The second document mentions that VSL#3 reduced weight loss following irinotecan when administered before and after chemotherapy, and this was associated with a significant increase in crypt proliferation combined with an inhibition of apoptosis in both the small and large intestines. The third document mentions that systemic, high-dose IL-6 administration to mice over 7-10 days resulted in intestinal hyperplasia with a approximately 40% increase in small bowel mass and in intestinal villus height, and this was associated with induction of pSTAT3 in enterocytes along the lower and middle regions of villi but not in crypts. The fourth document mentions that weanling, WNIN male rats received adlibitum for 17 wk: control diet (20% protein) or the same with 50% vitamin restriction. They were then sub-divided into two groups of six rats",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, alveolar macrophage gene expression is altered in the setting of alcohol use disorders. Whole genome microarray analysis was performed on alveolar macrophages obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage from a test cohort of subjects with AUDs and controls who were pair-matched on age, gender, and smoking. Probe set expression differences in this cohort were validated by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT RT-PCR). Functional analysis with web-based bioinformatics tools was utilized with microarray data to assess differentially expressed candidate genes (p < 0.01) based on alcohol consumption. Alveolar macrophage mRNA samples from a second cohort of subjects with AUDs and controls were used to confirm gene expression differences related to AUDs.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, a diminished postnatal surge of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants is not additional evidence for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The study found that the number of Ad spermatogonia in unilateral cryptorchid testes correlated in a nonlinear fashion with those in the contralateral scrotal testes, indicating that the development of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants is similar to that in the control population. The study also found that the total number of germ cells in the cryptorchid testes in the first six months of life is normal, after which it declines rapidly. Therefore, the diminished postnatal surge of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants is not evidence of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, female children were nearly three times more likely to be stunted than male children. Households that were food insecure with hunger were also three times more likely than other households to have a stunted child.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, combination therapy with VELCADE and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is neuroprotective in aged rats after stroke and targets microRNA-146a and the toll-like receptor signaling pathway. The study found that combination treatment with VELCADE and tPA modulates the TLR signaling pathway on cerebral vasculature, which leads to neuroprotection in aged rats after stroke. The study also found that the combination treatment increased miR-l46a levels, which was inversely associated with the reduction of vascular interleukin-1 receptor-activated kinases 1 immunoreactivity. In vitro, fibrin upregulated interleukin-1 receptor-activated kinases 1 and TLR4 expression and downregulated miR-146a on primary human cerebral endothelial cells. VELCADE elevated miR-146 levels and abolished fibrin-increased interleukin-1 receptor activated kinases 1 proteins.",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the study found that an increasing proportion of time spent performing chest compressions during cardiac arrest was associated with a higher likelihood of survival to hospital discharge in patients with out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. The study followed up 506 cases and found that after adjustment for age, gender, location, bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, bystander witness status, and response time, the odds ratios of surviving to hospital discharge in the 2 highest categories of chest compression fraction compared with the reference category were 3.01 (95% confidence interval 1.37 to 6.58) and 2.33 (95% confidence interval 0.96 to 5.63).",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, expression of snail in pancreatic cancer promotes metastasis and chemoresistance. In the study, it was found that snail expression was closely correlated with lymph node invasion and distant metastasis in pancreatic cancer. After transfecting snail cDNA into pancreatic cancer cell line Panc-1, it was found that snail triggered overt epithelial to mesenchymal transitions in Panc-1 cells, promoting the invasive ability of Panc-1 cells. Furthermore, overexpression of snail enhanced the chemoresistance to 5-fluorouracil of gemcitabine at different dosages. Additionally, snail-transfected Panc-1 cells produced more spontaneous metastasis than parental untransfected cells after orthotopically injected into the pancreas of nude mice.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, slug down-regulation by RNA interference inhibits invasion growth in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, prenatal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure affects maternal behavior and male offspring sexual behavior in adulthood. In the study, prenatal LPS exposure during the final 2 weeks of pregnancy induced schizophrenia-like behavioral symptoms, such as deficits in sensorimotor gating (prepulse inhibition) and impairments in social interactions and exploration, in adult offspring. Additionally, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that in the neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia, decreases in the total number of PV- and GAD67-positive neurons in the medial prefrontal cortices of adult females prenatally exposed to LPS were observed, whereas these immunochemical changes were primarily detected in the hippocampus of males. A decrease in PV-labeled axon terminals of GABA-ergic cells, likely reflecting the perisomatic inhibitory innervation of pyramidal neurons, was observed in the medial prefrontal cortices in both sexes.",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, pterygium is related to a decrease in corneal endothelial cell density. A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted on 90 consecutive patients with unilateral primary pterygium, and it was found that there was a significant relationship between the percentage of pterygium to cornea and a decrease in the corneal endothelial cell density. Additionally, an increase in astigmatism in eyes with pterygium was evaluated for association with decreased ECD using the Pearson correlation test.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, long-term reversal of hypocholesterolaemia in patients with chronic hepatitis C is related to sustained viral response and viral genotype. In patients with genotype-3 of HCV and sustained viral response, serum cholesterol increased from 138 (95% CI: 120-151) to 180 mg/dL (95% CI: 171-199) 12 months after treatment conclusion (P < 0.0001). By contrast, cholesterol values were unchanged in genotype-3 of HCV non-responders and in patients with genotype-1 of HCV regardless of response. This suggests that the reversal of hypocholesterolaemia in patients with genotype-3 of HCV is related to sustained viral response and viral genotype.",

The context discusses the association between a polymorphism of the CYP11B2 gene and hypertension in the Chinese population, but not the CYP19 gene.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, simple and complex alternative splicing (ASE) patterns may be subject to opposite selection forces for protein reading frame preservation. Simple ASEs have higher frame preservation (FRFP) than constitutively spliced exons (CSEs), while complex ASEs have lower FRFP than CSEs. The selection pressure on frame preservation is likely relaxed in complex ASEs because they may alter the ends of their flanking exons. Conservation of the ASE/CSE splicing pattern increases the FRFPs of simple ASEs but decreases those of complex ASEs. Contrary to the well-recognized concept of strong selection pressure on conserved ASEs for protein reading frame preservation, our results show that conserved complex ASEs are relaxed from such pressure and the frame-disrupting effect caused by the insertion of complex ASEs can be offset by compensatory changes in their flanking exons.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, high nuclear expression of HDGF correlates with disease progression and poor prognosis in human endometrial carcinoma. The study found that patients with increased HDGF expression levels had poorer overall survival rates than those with low expression of HDGF levels. Additionally, the higher expression of nuclear HDGF was associated significantly with T stage and clinical stage, but there was no association with lymph node or distant metastasis.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The provided context does not contain enough information to definitively answer this question. However, it does mention that 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scanning was used in follow-up of patients with Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) and in the initial assessment of patients with Huntington's disease (HD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In the study on ECD, FDG-PET scanning was used to assess the value of whole-body scanning in a large cohort of ECD patients from a single center. In the study on HD, FDG-PET scanning was used to predict age at onset in presymptomatic (preHD) subjects carrying the HD mutation. In the study on FTD, FDG-PET scanning was used to analyze normalized FDG uptake values with reference to the pons and to identify gender differences in glucose metabolism. In the study on pediatric HD, FDG-PET scanning was used to analyze patient outcome and progression-free survival (PFS) after chemotherapy. Therefore, it can be concluded that FDG-PET scanning can be useful in both the initial assessment and follow-up of patients with various diseases,",

Elevation in GLUN2 autoantibodies or complement protein C1q may be a potential underlying mechanism. A better understanding of these age-related differences may lead to more efficient treatments of behavioral disorders associated with T. gondii infection.",
      "These studies indicate that the rate and extent of risedronate absorption are independent of the site of administration along the gastrointestinal tract, and that the extent of absorption is not affected by the rate of administration.",
      "These findings indicate that NGAL reduces apoptosis by regulating the four apoptosis factors Bcl-2, Bax, Fas and FasL through its two receptors 24p3R and megalin. These results also suggest that ectopic expression of NGAL in renal cells might provide a therapeutic strategy in ischemia-reperfusion by reducing apoptosis and promoting renal cell proliferation.",
      "Increased BMI is associated with increased diurnal strains in articular cartilage of both the medial and lateral compartments of the knee. The increased cartilage strains observed in individuals with high BMI may, in part, explain the elevated risk of OA associated with obesity or may reflect alterations in the cartilage mechanical properties in subjects with high BMI.",
      "The data demonstrate that EA activates the adrenals to increase plasma corticosterone levels and suppress edema and suggest that EA effects differ in healthy subjects and in those with pathologies.",
      "Measurement of pleural fluid sp185(HER-2) has poor diagnostic performance in patients with malignant effusions.",
      "TMZ and BEV can directly cause the dysfunction of mitochondria isolated from human brain tumors. However, BEV has a greater ability to disturb mitochondrial function in mitochondria isolated from human brain tumors than either TMZ or calcium overload conditions.",
      "Similar urinary flows and osmolalities are associated with levels of plasma vasopressin and renal PGE2, which are higher in males than in females. Oxytocin does not seem to play a role in the diurnal urine formation, whereas prostaglandin E2 could represent a mediator of the gender difference, not only as a mediator of the vasopressin response, but also as an independent factor. These findings need further elucidation.",
      "MICR has a very transient impact on plasma levels of endostatin and no impact on angiostatin during the first 21 days following surgery. Thus, angiostatin and endostatin do not likely contribute to or inhibit the persistent proangiogenic changes noted after MICR.",
      "Dietary guidelines for CVD risk reduction may also benefit bone health in this Hispanic cohort. Synchronizing dietary guidelines for these 2 common diseases may provide a simplified public health message. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01231958.",
      "Basophils may worsen Th2 inflammatory disorders through direct interactions with pathogenic CD4 T cells as well as by enhancing DC-induced Th2 cell development.",
      "We conclude that inhibition of TLR4 with eritoran in an in situ murine model significantly reduces MI/R injury and markers of an inflammatory response.",
      "HMbeta supplementation can increase survival time and promotes metabolic changes in cancer-bearing animals, but it seems to work in a time-dependent manner.",
      "The probability of a successful cardioversion correlates inversely with NT-proBNP values. The short-term success of a cardioversion might be predicted by prior determination of NT-proBNP.",
      "These data provide evidence that there are no obvious adverse effects of acute or more chronic Cr supplementation on the haematological indices measured, nor on hepatic, muscle, and renal function. Therefore there is no apparent health risk associated with Cr supplementation to healthy people when it is ingested in quantities that have been scientifically proven to increase muscle Cr stores.",
      "Our data provide strong evidence that both cAMP effectors, Epac and PKA, and the levels of intracellular calcium are involved in the hepatic cystogenesis of ARPKD.",
      "All together, the pharmacological reactivity of STOP null mice to antipsychotics evokes the pharmacological response of humans to such drugs. Totally, our study suggests that STOP null mice may provide a useful preclinical model to evaluate pharmacological properties of antipsychotic drugs.",
      "This study confirms that C pneumoniae is a common finding in atherosclerotic plaques of the carotid artery but suggests that the presence of the infectious organism has little detectable impact on plaque instability when measured by clinically significant markers. This raises important questions for the rationale of antibiotic therapy in atherosclerosis.",
      "Moxibustion exerted its effect on healing impaired colonic mucosa in rats with TNBS-induced colitis by increasing the degranulation ratio of local MC, but had little effect on the morphology of MC at ST25 acupoint.",
      "Laser Doppler flowmetry detected circulatory abnormalities in primary open-angle glaucoma suspects who did not have any manifest visual field defect. Decreases in flow in glaucoma suspects were similar in magnitude to those of subjects with primary open-angle glaucoma. These data suggest that impaired optic nerve blood flow develops early in the glaucomatous process and does not develop solely as a result of glaucoma damage."
