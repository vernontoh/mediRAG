    "\nAnswer: Yes, The pathological observation of lung injury in experimental animals induced by non-ferrous metal ( tin ) dust shows that bronchoalveolar inflammation occurred in the early stage after the intratracheal instillation of Yunnan tin mineral dust was performed in F344 rats. Along with reduction of inflammation, collagen fibrils increased at alveolar interstices. Simple hyperplasia, papillary hyperplasia and metaplasia of the epithelial cells in alveolar and bronchi were observed, followed by atypical adenomatous hyperplasia and squamous dysplasia. Lung cancer was induced in the end. Among the 14 cases of lung cancer, 9 cases were adenocarcinoma, 2 squamous cell carcinoma and 3 mixed carcinoma. No lung cancer occurred in other three control groups. There was a significant difference in the malignancy rate between the experimental group and the three control groups (P < 0.01). The squamous metaplasia and squamous carcinoma were found in alveoli that expressed cytokeratin of High MW. Lung fibrosis was found in 31 cases of in the tin mineral dust group.

    "\n\nAnswer:\nNo, Antiangiogenic therapy of cerebral melanoma metastases does not result in sustained tumor progression via vessel co-option.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe context provides information about the use of antiangiogenic therapy for treating cerebral melanoma metastases. However, the question asks about the possibility of sustained tumor progression via vessel co-option.\n\nVessel co-option is a process where tumor cells invade and take over existing blood vessels, allowing them to continue growing and spreading. This process can be a major obstacle to effective antiangiogenic therapy, as it can lead to the formation of new blood vessels that supply the tumor with nutrients and oxygen.\n\nThe context does not provide any evidence to suggest that antiangiogenic therapy of cerebral melanoma metastases results in sustained tumor progression via vessel co-option. In fact, the context suggests that antiangiogenic therapy can be effective in treating cerebral melanoma metastases.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no. Antiangiogenic therapy of cerebral melanoma metastases does not result in sustained tumor progression via vessel co-option.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, Clove (100\u00b5g/well) and eugenol (50 or 100\u00b5g/well) inhibited IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-10 production and exerted an efficient action either before or after LPS challenge for all cytokines. Eugenol did not affect IL-1\u03b2 production but inhibited IL-6 and IL-10 production. The action of eugenol (50 or 100\u00b5g/well) on IL-6 production prevented efficiently effects of LPS either before or after its addition, whereas on IL-10 production it counteracted significantly LPS action when added after LPS incubation.",
    "\n\nAnswer:\nNo, Pretreatment with stellate ganglion blockade before ischemia does not reduce infarct size in rat hearts.\n\nExplanation:\nThe study investigates the role of stellate ganglion blockade (SGB) in cardio-protection against ischemia reperfusion injury. The study was carried out between August and October 2008 in the Department of Anesthesia, Abant Izzet Baysal University, Bolu, Turkey. Twenty-one rats were randomly divided into 3 groups; group 1--SGB group (rats with percutaneous ganglion blockade), group 2--preconditioned (P) group (rats that were subjected to ischemia and then reperfusion periods for 5 minutes), and group 3--control group (rats that were injected with normal saline). The study found that myocardial infarction (MI) induces neural remodelling of the left stellate ganglion (LSG), which may contribute to ischaemia-induced arrhythmias. The study also found that neural chemorepellent Semaphorin 3a (Sema3a) has been identified as a negative regulator of sympathetic innervation in the LSG and heart.

    "\nAnswer:\nYes, Non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) can impair insulin-mediated glucose uptake and disposition in the liver. This is supported by several studies that have shown an inverse association between NEFA concentrations and whole-body glucose disposal, as well as a decrease in insulin sensitivity index for NEFA. Additionally, treatment of adipocytes with palmitoleic acid, a type of NEFA, has been shown to increase basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and GLUT4 mRNA levels and protein content, while reducing de novo fatty acid synthesis from glucose and acetate and the activity of lipogenic enzymes glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and ATP-citrate lyase. These findings suggest that NEFAs can impair insulin-mediated glucose uptake and disposition in the liver, which can contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes.",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the present study tested the hypothesis that combination treatment with VELCADE and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) modulates the toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway on cerebral vasculature, which leads to neuroprotection in aged rats after stroke. The study found that combination treatment increased miR-146a levels, which was inversely associated with the reduction of vascular interleukin-1 receptor-activated kinases 1 immunoreactivity. In vitro, fibrin upregulated interleukin-1 receptor-activated kinases 1 and TLR4 expression and downregulated miR-146a on primary human cerebral endothelial cells. VELCADE elevated miR-146 levels and abolished fibrin-increased interleukin-1 receptor activated kinases 1 proteins. The study also found that the capacity of an intravenous infusion of double-stranded tissue-type plasminogen activator to salvage neurological functions in a rat model of thromboembolic stroke was studied. The sole Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for stroke is tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), but its brief therapeutic window and complications of treatment constrain",

    "\nAnswer:\nYes, Snail expression in pancreatic cancer promotes metastasis and chemoresistance. Snail expression has been demonstrated in many tumors and endows epithelial cells with migratory and anti-apoptotic abilities. In pancreatic cancer, Snail expression is associated with lymph node invasion and distant metastasis. After transfection of Snail cDNA into pancreatic cancer cell line Panc-1, Snail triggers overt epithelial to mesenchymal transitions in Panc-1 cells, promoting the invasive ability of Panc-1 cells in vitro. Snail overexpression enhances the chemoresistance of Panc-1 cells to 5-fluorouracil and gemcitabine at different dosages. Moreover, Snail-transfected Panc-1 cells produce more spontaneous metastasis than parental untransfected cells after orthotopically injected into the pancreas of nude mice.",

      "Our data show that, although angiogenesis can be effectively blocked by ZD6474, in vessel-dense organs this may result in sustained tumor progression via co-option, rather than in tumor dormancy. Importantly, blocking VEGF-A may result in undetectability of tumors in CE-MRI scans, leading to erroneous conclusions about therapeutic efficacy during magnetic resonance imaging follow-up. The maintenance of VEGF-A-induced vessel leakage in the absence of neovascularization at lower ZD6474 doses may be exploited to improve delivery of chemotherapeutic agents in combined treatment regimens of antiangiogenic and chemotherapeutic compounds.",
      "Clove exerted immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting LPS action. A possible mechanism of action probably involved the suppression of the nuclear factor-\u03baB pathway by eugenol, since it was the major compound found in clove extract.",

      "SUB885C, a multi-components preparation, is able to produce anti-atherogenic changes in lipids of the ApoE*3Leiden.CETP mice, which are comparable to those obtained with compounds belonging to known drugs (e.g. rimonabant, atorvastatin, niacin). This study successfully illustrated the power of lipidomics in unraveling intervention effects and to help finding new targets or ingredients for lifestyle-related metabolic abnormality.",
      "Expression of nm23-H1/NDP kinase is strongly upregulated in most EOCs. Redundant overexpression of nm23-H1/NDP kinase may contribute to deranged cell cycle progression and EOC proliferation. Pattern and intensity of nm23-H1/NDP kinase immunostaining of EOC tissue retrieved at primary operation may identify patients at risk for tumor progression and help guide treatment strategies. These findings suggest that nm23-H1 gene expression may have distinct if not opposite biologic functions in EOC and breast carcinoma.",
      "These results suggest that LTB(4) may enhance TNF-alpha-induced CCL27 production by activating NF-kappaB via the BLT1/G(i/o)/PI3K/ERK pathway in human keratinocytes. LTB(4) may contribute to the enhanced CCL27 production of keratinocytes in lesions with atopic dermatitis or allergic contact dermatitis.",

We conclude that the induction of oral tolerance to oxLDL may be a promising strategy to modulate the immune response during atherogenesis and a new way to treat atherosclerosis.",
      "The expected sex-based less atherogenic lipoprotein cholesterol distribution was not seen in women with type 1 diabetes. Moreover, insulin resistance was associated with a more atherogenic lipoprotein cholesterol distribution in all men and in women with type 1 diabetes. This lipoprotein cholesterol distribution may contribute to sex-based differences in CVD in type 1 diabetes.",

      "Rosuvastatin is effective in preventing LV remodelling and dysfunction in the failing heart. The molecular mechanism may be related to normalization of SERCA2a expression, SERCA activity, and pSer16-PLB levels, as well as through cytokine alterations independent of its lipid-lowering effect.",
      "EAC guidelines were safe, effective, and practically implemented in a level 1 trauma center. During the resuscitation course, increased exposure to acidosis was associated with a higher complication rate. Identifying the innate differences in the response, regulation, and resolution of acidosis in these critically injured patients is an important area for trauma research.",
      "Our findings suggest that NSC23925 can prevent the emergence of MDR in ovarian cancer both in vitro and in vivo. The clinical use of NSC2395 at the onset of chemotherapy may prevent the development of MDR and improve the clinical outcome of patients with ovarian cancer.",

      "Moderate PPM is common in patients undergoing AVR for aortic stenosis, but severe mismatch is rare. Patients with PPM have similar early and late postoperative survival rate.",
      "In conclusion, these findings indicate that long-term regular participation in sport and leisure activities categorized according to an osteogenic index [but not the total time (min) spent participating in all sport and leisure activities] was an important determinant of bone size, quality and strength, but not BMD, at loaded sites in older men. Furthermore, continued participation in weight-bearing exercise in early to mid-adulthood appears to be important for reducing the risk of low bone strength in old age.",
      "Unlike in mild and relatively early STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy, scarring of severely and chronically damaged kidneys is not attenuated by a 50% reduction of CCN2 to (near) normal levels. This suggests that CCN2 is either redundant in severe and chronic kidney disease, or that it is a limiting factor only at subnormal concentrations requiring further reduction by available or emerging therapies to prevent fibrosis of the severely injured kidney.",

      "Attachment of SF to LM-111 by itself has only minor effects on the expression of MMP-1 or MMP-3, but it facilitates the TGFbeta-induced expression of MMP-3 significantly. This mode of MMP-3 induction may therefore contribute to inflammatory joint destruction in RA independent of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)1beta or tumour necrosis factor (TNF)alpha.",
      "Health literacy is a significant factor in the health and treatment of persons living with HIV-AIDS. Interventions are needed to improve medical care and the health status of people with lower health literacy that are living with HIV-AIDS.",
      "Trans-aortic Alfieri stitch placement during septal myectomy is feasible in most cases as an additional tool to improve MR and minimize SAM.

      "A confirmation of the hypothesis would support efforts to generate a P. falciparum vaccine containing a comprehensive set of blood stage antigens, which, using adjuvant technology, would lead to the appropriate immunoglobulin subclass response. MEANS TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS: Detection of multiple immunorelevant P. falciparum blood stage antigens could be achieved by two-dimensional electrophoresis and blotting of the antigens onto nitrocellulose followed by exposure to the participant's serum. Bound immunoglobulins are visualized by isotype specific peroxidase conjugated anti-human immunoglobulin and quantified by transmission densitometry. The resulting pattern of responses for each immunoglobulin isotype could be compared between clinically immune participants remaining asymptomatic with subsequent P. falciparum infections and people who develop malaria. Immunorelevant antigens are identifiable by mass spectrometry with the fully decoded P. falciparum genome.",
      "Results indicated that the involvement of multiple recombination detection programs is very necessary. Additionally, results suggested two major challenges, one involving the difficulty of accurately determining the locations of breakpoints and the second involving identification of small regions of about 200 bases or fewer with greater caution. Both indicate the complexity of HIV-1 recombination. The resolution would depend critically on development of a recombination analysis algorithm, accumulation of HIV-1 stains, and a higher sequencing quality. With the changes in recombination pattern, phylogenetic relationships of some CRFs may also change. All these results may be critical to understand the role of recombination in a complex and dynamic HIV evolution.",

      "Stroke acutely activates the TLR signaling pathway on cerebral vasculature. Upregulation of miR-146a and inactivation of ischemia and tPA-potentiated TLR signaling pathway by VELCADE may play an important role in the neuroprotective effect of the combination therapy of VELCADE and tPA for acute stroke.",
      "Early life weight gain was negatively associated with flow indices in adolescence, suggesting structural changes in peripheral lungs.",

      "In this population, which included a high percentage of patients with luminal cancers, pCR did not predict for improved OS. Postneoadjuvant chemotherapy showed no discernible benefit even in subgroups with aggressive tumor biology or significant remaining tumor burden. The use of such treatment should therefore be discouraged outside of clinical trials.",

      "Circulating AFABP, produced by adipocytes and macrophages, and lipocalin-2, produced by multiple tissues, are elevated and may contribute to the metabolic syndrome in NAFLD. AFABP levels, which correlate with subcutaneous, but not visceral fat, independently predict inflammation and fibrosis in NAFLD and may have a direct pathogenic link to disease progression.",

      "In this study, we find that simple and complex ASEs undergo opposite selection pressure for protein reading frame preservation, with CSEs in-between. Simple ASEs have much higher FRFPs than complex ones. We further find that the FRFPs of complex ASEs coupled with flanking exons are close to those of simple ASEs, indicating that neighboring exons of an ASE may evolve in a coordinated way to avoid protein dysfunction. Therefore, we suggest that evolutionary analyses of AS should take into consideration the effects of different splicing patterns and the joint effects of multiple AS events.",
      "Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that HDGF was expressed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. High nuclear expression of HDGF was positively correlated with FIGO stage (P = 0.032), but not associated with other clinical features, such as histological grading or lymph node status. Patients with high expression of HDGF had poorer overall survival rates than those with low expression of HDGF (P = 0.001). However, multivariate analyses showed that high nuclear expression of HDGF protein was not an independent predictor of prognosis for EC patients (P = 0.111). Our results suggest that high nuclear expression of HDGF is a potential unfavorable factor for the progression and prognosis of EC.",
      "The results of our large, single-center, retrospective study suggest that the findings of a FDG-PET scan may be interesting in the initial assessment of patients with ECD, but its greater contribution is in followup of these patients.",
      "Over expression of UCP2 in certain tumors provides the rationale to speculate that UCP2 may promote tumor growth in these cancers.",
      "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading known genetic cause of autism spectrum disorders. Individuals with FXS show symptoms of auditory hypersensitivity. These symptoms may arise due to sustained neural responses to repeated sounds, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. For the first time, this study shows deficits in habituation of neural responses to repeated sounds in the Fmr1 KO mice as seen in humans with FXS. We also report an abnormally high level of matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) in the auditory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice and that deletion of Mmp-9 from Fmr1 KO mice reverses habituation deficits. These data provide a translation relevant electrophysiological biomarker for sensory deficits in FXS and implicate MMP-9 as a target for drug discovery.",
      "Prevalence of hay fever and sinusitis are correlated with air quality. Improvements in air quality are associated with decreased prevalence of both hay fever and sinusitis. Laryngoscope, 2009.",
      "S 23521 is an effective glucagon-like peptide-1-(7-36) amide analogue, which induced a decrease in energy intake, body weight, and adiposity in a rat model of diet-induced obesity. In addition, the treatment also improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity of obese rats. These results strongly support S 23521 as a putative molecule for the treatment of obesity.",
      "Our study demonstrates that the age at first exposure to T. gondii is an important factor in shaping distinct behavioral and neurobiological abnormalities. Elevation in GLUN2 autoantibodies or complement protein C1q may be a potential underlying mechanism. A better understanding of these age-related differences may lead to more efficient treatments of behavioral disorders associated with T. gondii infection.",
      "These studies indicate that the rate and extent of risedronate absorption are independent of the site of administration along the gastrointestinal tract, and that the extent of absorption is not affected by the rate of administration.",
      "These findings indicate that NGAL reduces apoptosis by regulating the four apoptosis factors Bcl-2, Bax, Fas and FasL through its two receptors 24p3R and megalin. These results also suggest that ectopic expression of NGAL in renal cells might provide a therapeutic strategy in ischemia-reperfusion by reducing apoptosis and promoting renal cell proliferation.",
      "Increased BMI is associated with increased diurnal strains in articular cartilage of both the medial and lateral compartments of the knee. The increased cartilage strains observed in individuals with high BMI may, in part, explain the elevated risk of OA associated with obesity or may reflect alterations in the cartilage mechanical properties in subjects with high BMI.",

      "Similar urinary flows and osmolalities are associated with levels of plasma vasopressin and renal PGE2, which are higher in males than in females. Oxytocin does not seem to play a role in the diurnal urine formation, whereas prostaglandin E2 could represent a mediator of the gender difference, not only as a mediator of the vasopressin response, but also as an independent factor. These findings need further elucidation.",
      "MICR has a very transient impact on plasma levels of endostatin and no impact on angiostatin during the first 21 days following surgery. Thus, angiostatin and endostatin do not likely contribute to or inhibit the persistent proangiogenic changes noted after MICR.",
      "Dietary guidelines for CVD risk reduction may also benefit bone health in this Hispanic cohort. Synchronizing dietary guidelines for these 2 common diseases may provide a simplified public health message. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01231958.",
      "Basophils may worsen Th2 inflammatory disorders through direct interactions with pathogenic CD4 T cells as well as by enhancing DC-induced Th2 cell development.",
      "We conclude that inhibition of TLR4 with eritoran in an in situ murine model significantly reduces MI/R injury and markers of an inflammatory response.",
      "HMbeta supplementation can increase survival time and promotes metabolic changes in cancer-bearing animals, but it seems to work in a time-dependent manner.",
      "The probability of a successful cardioversion correlates inversely with NT-proBNP values. The short-term success of a cardioversion might be predicted by prior determination of NT-proBNP.",
      "These data provide evidence that there are no obvious adverse effects of acute or more chronic Cr supplementation on the haematological indices measured, nor on hepatic, muscle, and renal function. Therefore there is no apparent health risk associated with Cr supplementation to healthy people when it is ingested in quantities that have been scientifically proven to increase muscle Cr stores.",
      "Our data provide strong evidence that both cAMP effectors, Epac and PKA, and the levels of intracellular calcium are involved in the hepatic cystogenesis of ARPKD.",
      "All together, the pharmacological reactivity of STOP null mice to antipsychotics evokes the pharmacological response of humans to such drugs. Totally, our study suggests that STOP null mice may provide a useful preclinical model to evaluate pharmacological properties of antipsychotic drugs.",
      "This study confirms that C pneumoniae is a common finding in atherosclerotic plaques of the carotid artery but suggests that the presence of the infectious organism has little detectable impact on plaque instability when measured by clinically significant markers. This raises important questions for the rationale of antibiotic therapy in atherosclerosis.",
      "Moxibustion exerted its effect on healing impaired colonic mucosa in rats with TNBS-induced colitis by increasing the degranulation ratio of local MC, but had little effect on the morphology of MC at ST25 acupoint.",
      "Laser Doppler flowmetry detected circulatory abnormalities in primary open-angle glaucoma suspects who did not have any manifest visual field defect. Decreases in flow in glaucoma suspects were similar in magnitude to those of subjects with primary open-angle glaucoma. These data suggest that impaired optic nerve blood flow develops early in the glaucomatous process and does not develop solely as a result of glaucoma damage."
