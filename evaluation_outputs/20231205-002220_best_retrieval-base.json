    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is characterized by dynamic impairment of active relaxation and contraction of the left ventricle on exercise and associated with myocardial energy deficiency.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, soluble ( Pro ) Renin Receptor is a predictor of gestational diabetes mellitus. The study found that plasma s( Pro )RR levels were positively associated with serum Cr, BUN, UA levels, CKD stage, and urine protein/Cr ratio, and inversely with estimated glomerular infiltration rate (eGFR) and Hb. Additionally, soluble ( Pro )RR levels were inversely associated with \u03b1-Klotho levels but did not correlate with prorenin levels. With respect to antihypertensive drugs, soluble ( Pro )RR levels were significantly lower in patients treated with an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) than in those without ARB therapy. Soluble ( Pro )RR levels were significantly lower in CKD patients with diabetes mellitus or primary hypertension than in those without these conditions. Finally, with respect to the relationship between basal soluble ( Pro )RR levels and the progression rates of renal function, soluble ( Pro )RR levels were positively associated with \u0394Cr and inversely associated with \u0394eGFR.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, obvious emphysema on computed tomography during an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is associated with a poor prognosis and emphysema progression through unknown mechanisms.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the study compares levels of both genital mucosal and blood chemokines between HIV-1-uninfected and HIV-1-infected female commercial sex workers (CSWs) as well as HIV-1-uninfected non-CSW control women at low risk for exposure, recruited in Cotonou, Benin. The study also examines the association between bacterial vaginosis (BV) and BV-associated bacteria and expression of HIV in the female genital tract. Additionally, the study determines whether the female genital tract contains factors that affect HIV-1 replication by collecting cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) samples from HIV-1-seropositive and seronegative women and adding them to cell cultures. Cytokines/chemokines were quantified by Luminex assay in cervicovaginal lavage, and cellular phenotypes were characterized using immunohistochemistry in cervical biopsies. Comparisons of cytokine/chemokine concentrations and the percent of tissue staining positive for T cells were compared using generalized estimating equations between non-shedding and shedding visits across all women and within a subgroup of women who intermittently shed HIV-1.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the pathological observation of lung injury in experimental animals induced by non-ferrous metal ( tin ) dust is described in the provided context.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the study investigates the methylation status of these genes and analyzes the role of their DNA methylation in gastric carcinoma.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, antiangiogenic therapy of cerebral melanoma metastases does not result in sustained tumor progression via vessel co-option. This is because the study found that tumor expansion in cerebral melanoma metastases is dependent on neovascularization, which is a process that requires sustained new vessel formation. The study also found that angiogenesis involving bone marrow-derived endothelial cells does not contribute to this process. Therefore, antiangiogenic therapy targeting endothelial sprouting would not be effective in preventing tumor progression in cerebral melanoma metastases.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, clove and eugenol in noncytotoxic concentrations exert immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory action on cytokine production by murine macrophages. Clove (100\u00b5g/well) inhibited IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-10 production and exerted an efficient action either before or after LPS challenge for all cytokines. Eugenol did not affect IL-1\u03b2 production but inhibited IL-6 and IL-10 production. The action of eugenol (50 or 100\u00b5g/well) on IL-6 production prevented efficiently effects of LPS either before or after its addition, whereas on IL-10 production it counteracted significantly LPS action when added after LPS incubation.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, pretreatment with stellate ganglion blockade before ischemia does not reduce infarct size in rat hearts. In fact, ganglionic blockade may increase the risk of neurologic outcome and stroke-related mortality in rats with increased plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine during ischemia.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, lipidomics can reveal multiple pathway effects of a multi-components preparation on lipid biochemistry in ApoE*3Leiden.CETP mice. According to the provided context, the combination of lipidomic and gene expression analyses allows us to reveal the correlation between the altered lipid profile with significantly enriched pathways, such as one carbon pool by folate, arachidonic acid metabolism, insulin signaling pathway, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, propanoate metabolism, and starch and sucrose metabolism.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, elevated nm23 protein expression is not correlated with diminished progression-free survival in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, leukotriene B ( 4 ) potently enhances tumour necrosis factor-alpha-induced CCL27 secretion and mRNA expression in human keratinocytes.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, hemoglobin levels do not predict biochemical outcome for localized prostate cancer treated with neoadjuvant androgen-suppression therapy and external-beam radiotherapy.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, non-esterified fatty acids decreased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, insulin content and increased triglyceride content of human isolated islets, independently from the deleterious effect of glucose. Increased glucose concentrations also decreased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and insulin content, but had no influence on triglyceride content. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion of islets appeared to be significantly correlated with their triglyceride content.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, induction of oral tolerance to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) has been shown to attenuate the initiation and progression of atherogenesis in LDL receptor-/- mice fed a Western-type diet. This is due to an increase in CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ cells in spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes, which specifically respond to oxLDL with increased transforming growth factor-beta production. Additionally, tolerance to oxLDL increased the mRNA expression of Foxp3, CTLA-4, and CD25 in the plaque. In contrast, tolerance to malondialdehyde-treated low-density lipoprotein (MDA-LDL) did not affect atherogenesis.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, in women with type 1 diabetes and insulin resistance, a more atherogenic cholesterol distribution by insulin resistance was seen.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, options in pediatric glaucoma after angle surgery have failed.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the present study tested the hypothesis that rosuvastatin treatment may attenuate left ventricular (LV) remodelling and dysfunction in the failing heart, which may be associated with alterations of calcium-regulatory protein. The study found that rosuvastatin prevented LV remodelling and dysfunction by increasing SERCA activity and reducing IL-6 level and further elevating IL-10 level in the peri-infarct and remote zones of MI. The protein expression of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA)2a, phospholamban (PLB), and phospho-PLB at serine-16 (pSer16-PLB), as well as SERCA activity, was evaluated and showed that rosuvastatin prevented the decrease of SERCA2a and pSer16-PLB expression, increased SERCA activity, but showed no effect on PLB expression.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, prolonged resuscitation of metabolic acidosis after trauma is associated with more complications. The study found that in patients with successful resuscitation and controlled intracranial pressure (ICP), 76% had low glucose, 93% had elevated lactate production rate (LPR), and 74% were in metabolic crisis within 72 hours of trauma. The duration of metabolic crisis was longer in those patients with unfavorable (GOSe \u2264 6) versus favorable (GOSe \u2265 7) outcome at 6 months (P = 0.011). In four multivariate models, the burden of metabolic crisis was a powerful independent predictor of poor outcome.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, nSC23925 has been shown to prevent the development of multidrug resistance in ovarian cancer cells in vitro. Additionally, the study found that nSC23925 also prevented the emergence of multidrug resistance in ovarian cancer in vivo.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, restoration of klotho expression induces apoptosis and autophagy in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, leukocytosis is proportional to HELLP syndrome severity. The study found that patients with HELLP syndrome had significantly higher white blood cell counts than patients with severe preeclampsia alone. Additionally, patients with class I HELLP syndrome had significantly higher white blood cell counts than patients with other classes of HELLP syndrome. This suggests that there is an inflammatory component to preeclampsia, which is characterized by an imbalance of circulating pro- and anti-angiogenic factors. The study also found that thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), a pro-thrombotic and anti-angiogenic factor, is derived from the endothelium and platelets and exerts potent pro-thrombotic and anti-angiogenic effects. This suggests that TSP-1 may play a role in the development of HELLP syndrome.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the study found that DcR3 overexpression correlated with lymph node metastases and TNM stages in pancreatic head carcinoma. Additionally, the median overall survival for the high DcR3 group was 16.3 months, compared to 21.6 months for the low DcR3 group (P < 0.05).",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, a Multi-Component Prime-Boost Vaccination Regimen with a Consensus MOMP Antigen enhances Chlamydia trachomatis Clearance. The DNA-HuAd5-MVA-Protein vaccine regimen induced a cellular response with a Th1-biased serum antibody response, alongside high serum and vaginal MOMP-specific antibodies. This regimen significantly enhanced clearance against intravaginal C. trachomatis serovar D infection in both BALB/c and B6C3F1 mouse strains. This enhanced clearance was shown to be CD4(+) T-cell dependent.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the angiotensin II type 2 receptor agonist Compound 21 (C21) was found to be protective in experimental diabetes-associated atherosclerosis (DAA) in vivo and in vitro. C21 treatment significantly attenuated aortic plaque deposition in a mouse model of DAA, in association with a decreased infiltration of macrophages and mediators of inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis. Additionally, C21 was found to confer profound anti-atherosclerotic actions at the in vitro level, particularly in the setting of hyperglycaemia. These atheroprotective actions of C21 were completely blocked by the AT2R antagonist PD123319. However, the combination therapy with C21 and candesartan (AT1R antagonist) appeared to have a limited additive effect in attenuating the pathology of DAA when compared with either treatment alone.",
    "\n\nAnswer: It is unclear whether cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is independently linked to cardiometabolic risk in children. This study investigated the association between CRF level and presence of cardiometabolic risk disorders using health-related cut points, and whether these associations were mediated by abdominal adiposity in children. The strong relation between CRF and adiposity renders their independent associations to metabolic risk factors difficult to ascertain. To examine the independent associations of muscular and cardiorespiratory fitness with clustered metabolic risk in adolescents, and to examine the independent associations of muscle fitness and cardiorespiratory fitness with clustered metabolic risk in youth, more research is needed. Although fitness and obesity have been shown to be independent predictors of cardiometabolic disease risk in obese children, this interaction is not well defined in nonobese children. The purpose of this study was to define the relationships between peak aerobic capacity, body composition, and fasting insulin levels in nonobese middle school children.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, patient-prosthesis mismatch in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement can affect survival. A study found that patients with prosthesis-patient mismatch had significantly higher transprosthesis gradients postoperatively and an independent detrimental effect of prosthesis-patient mismatch on survival was observed in patients with aortic stenosis/mixed disease who had preoperative left ventricular dysfunction. In addition, the degree of prosthesis-patient mismatch was a significant predictor of poorer survival, even after adjustment for all significant clinical predictors.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, a high frequency of competitive sports early in life is associated with greater bone mineral density (BMD) at several bone sites in older men, indicating that increases in BMD following physical activity (PA) are preserved longer than previously believed. However, it is unclear if the positive effects of PA remain at old age.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, hemizygous deletion of CTGF/CCN2 does not suffice to prevent fibrosis of the severely injured kidney. The study examined the effects of CCN2 haploinsufficiency on the progression of renal scarring in long-term STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy, in a more advanced stage of obstructive nephropathy following unilateral ureteric obstruction (UUO), and in severe aristolochic acid (AA)-induced tubulotoxic nephritis. The results showed that hemizygous deletion of CTGF/CCN2 did not prevent fibrosis of the severely injured kidney.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the study found that severity of hepatic encephalopathy before orthotopic liver transplantation correlated with quality of life after transplantation. The Sickness Impact Profile was administered before and after surgery to document quality of life across multiple health and psychosocial dimensions.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, sutureless securement device StatLock has been shown to reduce catheter-related complications when compared to tape in earlier studies. The purpose of the current study was to determine whether a sutureless securement device offers an advantage over suture in preventing catheter-related complications. The study found that sutureless securement device StatLock significantly reduced catheter-related complications compared to suture.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, attachment of synovial fibroblasts (SFs) to laminin-111 did not activate the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), but addition of transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) induced a fivefold higher expression of MMP-3. Incubation of SF on laminin-111 in the presence of TGFbeta induced a significant 12-fold higher expression of MMP-3 mRNA, and secretion of MMP-3 was elevated 20-fold above controls. Functional blocking of laminin-111-integrin interaction reduced the laminin-activated MMP-3 expression significantly.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, functional health literacy is associated with health status and health-related knowledge in people living with HIV-AIDS. HIV-infected people with lower health literacy had lower CD4 cell counts, higher viral loads, were less likely to be taking antiretroviral medications, reported a greater number of hospitalizations, and reported poorer health than those with higher health literacy. In addition, lower health literacy was associated with poorer knowledge of one's HIV-related health status, poorer AIDS-related disease and treatment knowledge, and more negative health care perceptions and experiences.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, trans-aortic Alfieri stitch is a technique that is used at the time of septal myectomy for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study found that computer-assisted instruction (CAI) tutorial program improved clinical reasoning skills of undergraduate dietetics students. The study also found that Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCE) significantly improved students' mean readiness to practice their role as clinical dietitians in all areas, but not all areas reached statistical significance. Seventy-six percent of students found the OSCE to be superior to the medical center experience, and 78% of students agreed that collaboration with other healthcare professionals helped prepare them for the dietetic role. The study also compared scores on the simulation test and found that mastery of objectives related to lower- and higher-level clinical reasoning skills introduced in the tutorial program was computed.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, soy protein isolates of varied isoflavone content can influence serum thyroid hormones in healthy young men. A study was conducted to determine the effects of consumption of soy protein of varying isoflavone content on parameters of semen quality in healthy young men. Thirty-five healthy men supplemented their habitual diets with milk protein isolate (MPI), low-isoflavone soy protein isolate (low-iso SPI; 1.64 +/- 0.19 mg iso/day), and high-isoflavone SPI (high-iso SPI; 61.7 +/- 7.4 mg iso/day) for 57 days each, separated by 4-week washouts in a randomized crossover design. Blood was collected on days 1, 29, and 57 of each treatment for analysis of total triiodothyronine (T3), free T3, total thyroxine (T4), free T4, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and thyroid binding globulin (TBG). The results showed that high-iso SPI supplementation significantly decreased free T3 and free T4 levels compared to MPI and low-iso SPI supplementation. However, there were no significant differences in T3, T4, TSH, or T",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, immunity to blood stages of Plasmodium falciparum is dependent on a specific pattern of immunoglobulin subclass responses to multiple blood stage antigens. This hypothesis results from previous studies showing that IgG1 and IgG3 responses against antigens like ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigens, merozoite surface proteins and variant surface antigens on schizonts were associated with clinical immunity against malaria. None of the specific responses against a single antigen was completely protective.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the reanalysis of recombination patterns of some HIV-1 circulating recombination forms (CRFs) suggests the necessity and difficulty of revision. The current study was based on multiple recombination analysis, which may have produced more impartial results. The study found that some CRFs, like CRF04 and CRF06, have undergone repeated analysis and upgrades. Such revisions may also be necessary for other CRFs. The study also highlights the difficulty of revision, as previous studies were based primarily on a single recombination detection program, which may have produced biased results.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, osteopontin (OPN) has been identified as the most highly upregulated factor early after neonatal cerebral hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury. Therefore, it is likely that OPN plays a role in endogenous repair after HI brain injury. However, further research is needed to determine the specific mechanisms by which OPN enhances repair and to identify other molecules that may be involved in the repair process.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, xenon pretreatment attenuates anesthetic-induced apoptosis in the developing brain in comparison with nitrous oxide and hypoxia.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, p130 plays a role in TGF-beta-induced cell-cycle arrest in Rb mutant HT-3 cells. TGF-beta inhibited the proliferation of HT-3 cells expressing mutant Rb protein and efficiently induced cell-cycle arrest at G(1) phase. p21 protein level was elevated in TGF-beta-treated HT-3 cells, while other G(1) regulatory protein levels were unaltered. TGF-beta markedly enhanced the binding of p21 with cdk2 but decreased that of cdk2 with cyclin E and inhibited the phosphorylation of p130 but did not change Rb and p107 protein status. E2F-1 protein level was lower in TGF-beta-treated cells, and it is suggested that this might be the result of enhanced binding between E2F-4 and p130.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, past cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3, obesity, and earlier menopause are associated with an increased risk of vulval cancer in postmenopausal women.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, severity of coronary artery disease is correlated to cerebrovascular reactivity, but degree of coronary stenosis is not.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the objective of the study was to examine the association of family-centered rounds with family experiences and health services use. The study compared families with a child admitted to general pediatric inpatient services with and without FCR. The presence of FCR elements was assessed before study enrollment. Study data were obtained by an in-person interview, a follow-up phone interview <1 week after discharge, and medical record review. Family outcomes were informed by Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems measures. Health service use outcomes included hour of discharge, number of medications, and overall charges. Primary analyses included \u03c7(2) and multivariate regression. Secondary analyses by using propensity score matching were performed to account for differences on observed variables.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, high doses of EDU were not toxic to willow and did not act as nitrogen fertilizer. However, EDU increased the leaf nitrogen content.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, high maternal body mass index (BMI) increases the risk of neonatal early onset group B streptococcal (EOGBS) disease. In obese parturients with BMI > 30, there was an 80% increased risk for verified neonatal EOGBS disease. When cases with clinical sepsis were included, a significant risk increment was also found in overweight women with BMI 25.0-29.9. The highest TG level was associated with a higher BW SDS and with a higher prevalence of an infant large for gestational age compared with middle quintile. Infants from mothers in the lowest TG quintile had lower SDS in weight, length, and body mass index until age 3 months, and displayed accelerated postnatal growth patterns. Maternal TC was not associated with BW or postnatal growth.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) decreases acute pneumonitis after irradiation in vitro and in vivo.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, thymoglobulin administered early after heart transplantation reduces early myocardial hypertrophy assessed by morphometric studies. The study by [Document(page_content='The aim of this study was to assess the effects of early thymoglobulin administration on cardiocyte nuclear status in orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) recipients.')] found that thymoglobulin administration reduced myocardial hypertrophy in OHT recipients. The study used morphometric studies to quantify cardiocyte nuclear area, length, breadth, perimeter, chromatin median grey level, and fullness factor. The results showed that thymoglobulin administration reduced myocardial hypertrophy compared to the standard group who were treated without thymoglobulin.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, dNA-PKcs expression was found to be a predictor of biochemical recurrence (BCR) after permanent iodine-125 interstitial brachytherapy for prostate cancer. In the study, positive dNA-PKcs nuclear staining was closely associated with BCR (P=.0002). On multivariate analysis, dNA-PKcs status remained predictive of recurrence (P=.01).",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, chemotherapy for cancer does not cause apoptosis that precedes hypoplasia in crypts of the small intestine in humans. According to the provided context, apoptosis increased sevenfold in intestinal crypts at one day, and villus area, crypt length, mitotic count per crypt, and enterocyte height decreased at three days after chemotherapy. However, disaccharidase activities remained unchanged. Electron microscopy showed increased open tight junctions of enterocytes at day 3, consistent with more immature cells. All indices improved by 16 days. Therefore, chemotherapy for cancer does not cause apoptosis that precedes hypoplasia in crypts of the small intestine in humans.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, alveolar macrophage gene expression is altered in the setting of alcohol use disorders. A study was conducted on alveolar macrophages obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage from a test cohort of subjects with AUDs and controls who were pair-matched on age, gender, and smoking. Probe set expression differences in this cohort were validated by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT RT-PCR). Functional analysis with web-based bioinformatics tools was utilized with microarray data to assess differentially expressed candidate genes (p < 0.01) based on alcohol consumption. Alveolar macrophage mRNA samples from a second cohort of subjects with AUDs and controls were used to confirm gene expression differences related to AUDs.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, a diminished postnatal surge of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants does not necessarily indicate hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The study found that the number of Ad spermatogonia in unilateral cryptorchid testes correlated in a nonlinear fashion with those in the contralateral scrotal testes, and the total number of germ cells in the cryptorchid testes in the first six months of life is normal, after which it declines rapidly. Therefore, it is possible that the development of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants is not affected by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, female children were nearly three times more likely to be stunted than male children. Households that were food insecure with hunger were also three times more likely than other households to have a stunted child.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, combination therapy with VELCADE and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is neuroprotective in aged rats after stroke and targets microRNA-146a and the toll-like receptor signaling pathway. The study found that combination treatment with VELCADE and tPA modulates the TLR signaling pathway on cerebral vasculature, which leads to neuroprotection in aged rats after stroke. The study also found that the combination treatment increased miR-l46a levels, which was inversely associated with the reduction of vascular interleukin-1 receptor-activated kinases 1 immunoreactivity. In vitro, fibrin upregulated interleukin-1 receptor-activated kinases 1 and TLR4 expression and downregulated miR-146a on primary human cerebral endothelial cells. VELCADE elevated miR-146 levels and abolished fibrin-increased interleukin-1 receptor activated kinases 1 proteins.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, peak weight velocity in infancy is positively associated with spirometric lung function indices at 15 years of age.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, the provided context does not mention S-allylmercaptocysteine as a hepato-protective agent in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in vivo animal model. The context only mentions S-allylmercaptocysteine as a potential antimetastatic drug with broad clinical applications that was tested in vivo for the first time in a study.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the proportion of time in which chest compressions are performed during cardiopulmonary resuscitation is an important modifiable aspect of quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation and has been shown to determine survival to hospital discharge in patients with out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, expression of snail in pancreatic cancer promotes metastasis and chemoresistance. In the study, snail expression was found to be closely correlated with lymph node invasion and distant metastasis in pancreatic cancer. After transfecting snail cDNA into pancreatic cancer cell line Panc-1, the study found that snail triggered overt epithelial to mesenchymal transitions in Panc-1 cells, which promoted the invasive ability of Panc-1 cells in vitro. Moreover, snail-transfected Panc-1 cells produced more spontaneous metastasis than parental untransfected cells after orthotopically injected into the pancreas of nude mice. The study also found that overexpression of snail enhanced the chemoresistance to 5-fluorouracil of gemcitabine at different dosages.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, knockdown of SLUG by RNA interference significantly inhibited lung cancer cell invasion and metastasis in vitro.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, postoperative CMF does not ameliorate poor outcomes in women with residual invasive breast cancer after neoadjuvant epirubicin/docetaxel chemotherapy.\n\nExplanation: The study included 36 women with moderately advanced local breast cancer larger than 2 cm in diameter. Twelve were allocated to receive a standard regimen of 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (FEC) preoperatively as controls, and 24 were given the most suitable regimen according to testing; the options were FEC, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF), 5-fluorouracil, adriamycin and mitomycin C (FAM) and paclitaxel alone. The cell activities of drug-treated solid tumors were compared to controls with a highly sensitive ATP bioluminescence assay. Patients received chemotherapy according to sensitivity results and the tumor area clinically measured before and after chemotherapy.\n\nThe study did not find that postoperative CMF ameliorated poor outcomes in women with residual invasive breast cancer after neoadjuvant epirubicin/docetaxel chemotherapy. The study included eight patients who received a combination",
    "\n\nAnswer: The WD40 domain is required for LRRK2 neurotoxicity. Removing the WD40 domain prevents complex formation and autophosphorylation, and completely blocks the neurotoxicity of multiple LRRK2 PD mutations.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the hypothesis that inhibition of leukocyte function by administration of monoclonal antibody 60.3 (MoAb 60.3) improves electrophysiological recovery and decreases injury volume following transient focal cerebral ischemia in cats is supported by the results of the study.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, prenatal lipopolysaccharide exposure during the final 2 weeks of pregnancy can induce schizophrenia-like behavioral symptoms, such as deficits in sensorimotor gating (prepulse inhibition) and impairments in social interactions and exploration, in adult offspring. Additionally, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that in the neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia, decreases in the total number of PV- and GAD67-positive neurons in the medial prefrontal cortices of adult females prenatally exposed to LPS were observed, whereas these immunochemical changes were primarily detected in the hippocampus of males. Furthermore, a decrease in PV-labeled axon terminals of GABA-ergic cells, likely reflecting the perisomatic inhibitory innervation of pyramidal neurons, was observed in the medial prefrontal cortices in both sexes. Compared to the control group, the LPS-treated dams presented reduced maternal behavior, decreased general activity, a smaller body weight difference between GD21 and PND1, a greater number of perinatal deaths, and smaller litters. For the male pups, LPS treatment resulted in a decreased body weight on PND2, whereas the anogenital",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (AFABP) levels are significantly elevated in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and correlate with indices of adiposity. AFABP is a key mediator of inflammatory response in macrophages and has been observed to be increased in patients with NAFLD. Additionally, AFABP has been associated with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in type 2 diabetes.",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, as a pitcher approaches muscular fatigue during a simulated baseball game, pitching biomechanics will be significantly different than they were before muscular fatigue. The study found that compared with the initial 2 innings, as a pitcher approached muscular fatigue during the final 2 innings, there was a significant decrease in ball velocity, and the trunk was significantly closer to a vertical position. There were no other significant differences in kinematics or kinetics variables.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the bisphosphonate Pamidronate has been shown to improve chemically induced trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid and dextran sulfate sodium colitis in rats and lymphocyte transfer colitis in mice. Pamidronate has no effect on intestinal epithelial cells in vitro in terms of cytokine/chemokine release, but enhances IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, and IL-10 production by T cells in coculture. Pamidronate also exerts a direct immunomodulatory effect on T cells, favoring Th1 differentiation and impairing Th17 polarization. However, the use of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (N-BPs) has been reported to be associated with gastrointestinal intolerance, and complications associated with long-term administration of bisphosphonates, such as nonunion after pelvic insufficiency fracture or osteonecrosis of the jaw, have been recently reported in the literature. Therefore, further studies are needed to determine the safety and efficacy of Pamidronate as an intestinal antiinflammatory agent in humans.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, experience with bilateral cochlear implants can improve sound localization acuity in children. A study found that children who received bilateral cochlear implants showed a significant improvement in sound localization compared to those who received unilateral cochlear implants. Additionally, the study found that children who received bilateral cochlear implants performed better on a right-left discrimination task, which measures the minimum audible angle (MAA) for sound localization.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, gM-CSF does not contribute to prompt healing of ecthyma gangrenosum lesions in kidney transplant recipient.\n\nExplanation: The provided context does not mention anything about the role of gM-CSF in the healing of ecthyma gangrenosum lesions in kidney transplant recipients. The context only mentions the role of gM-CSF in wound healing in diabetic mice and its potential effects on heart transplant recipients. Therefore, it is not possible to answer the question based on the provided context.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, pterygium is related to a decrease in corneal endothelial cell density. The study found a strong logarithmic correlation between a decrease in the corneal ECD and the percentage of pterygium to cornea.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, long-term reversal of hypocholesterolaemia in patients with chronic hepatitis C is related to sustained viral response and viral genotype. Genotype-3 of HCV patients had age-adjusted hypocholesterolaemia and more frequent hepatic steatosis. Steatosis was inversely correlated with serum cholesterol and directly with viral load. In patients with genotype-3 of HCV and sustained viral response, serum cholesterol increased from 138 (95% CI: 120-151) to 180 mg/dL (95% CI: 171-199) 12 months after treatment conclusion (P < 0.0001). By contrast, cholesterol values were unchanged in genotype-3 of HCV non-responders and in patients with genotype-1 of HCV regardless of response. Rising cholesterol in sustained viral response did not parallel the changes in beta-hydroxybutyrate.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The present study aimed to see if life style interventions/weight reduction could decrease cathepsin L and S levels in blood plasma. However, the study did not specifically investigate the association between life style interventions and decreased levels of cathepsins L and S in moderately overweight individuals. The study did find that higher cathepsin S was associated with higher CRP and IL-6 in both normal-weight and overweight participants. However, the study did not investigate the association between life style interventions and decreased levels of cathepsins L and S in moderately overweight individuals.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, the study did not find a significant association between the novel polymorphism of the CYP19 gene and essential hypertension in China.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, simple and complex alternative splicing exons (ASEs) may be subject to opposite selection forces for protein reading frame preservation. Simple ASEs have higher frame preservation frequency (FRFP) than constitutively spliced exons (CSEs), while complex ASEs have lower FRFP than CSEs. Conservation of the ASE/CSE splicing pattern increases the FRFPs of simple ASEs but decreases those of complex ASEs. Furthermore, complex ASEs may alter the ends of their flanking exons, leading to relaxed selection pressure on frame preservation.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, high nuclear expression of HDGF correlates with disease progression and poor prognosis in human endometrial carcinoma. A study conducted on 122 endometrial carcinoma patients found that higher HDGF expression was significantly associated with lymphatic metastasis and poorer 5-year overall survival rate. Additionally, HDGF expression was found to be an independent prognostic factor for patient survival. Experiments in vitro also showed that HDGF exists in all ovarian cancer cell lines with different expression levels.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, the usefulness of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in assessing Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) has not been clearly defined. Therefore, it is not more useful in follow-up than in the initial assessment of patients with ECD.",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, matrix metalloproteinase-9 deletion reverses auditory evoked potential habituation deficit in a mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, air quality can influence the prevalence of hay fever and sinusitis. The National Health Interview Survey for the calendar years 1997-2006 adult sample was analyzed to determine for each calendar year the one-year period prevalence of the two respiratory conditions, hay fever and sinusitis and the nonrespiratory (control) condition, weak/failing kidneys. From the Environmental Protection Agency, yearly historical data for air quality criteria pollutants, carbon monoxide, nitrous dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter, were tabulated. Graphical and linear regression analyses were conducted for each disease condition against each of the air quality variables to determine if higher pollutant concentrations predicted a higher prevalence for the disease condition.\n\nNasal irritation and associated symptoms (nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and sinus headache) are important elements of the response to indoor and outdoor air pollution. Marked interindividual variability in such symptoms has been suggested clinically and epidemiologically, but little experimental data exist on this issue.\n\nFifty patients (mean age, 23.7 +/- 4.9 years) with hay fever were evaluated both during and outside pollen season. All of them had moderate-severe grade of nasal obstruction. Total",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the age of first exposure to Toxoplasma gondii can affect the neurobehavioral pathology and the immune response in mice. Juvenile and adult infected mice exhibited opposite effects of MK-801 on PPI, with decreased PPI in juveniles and increased PPI in adults. There was a significantly greater elevation of GLUN2 autoantibodies in juvenile-compared to adult-infected mice. In addition, age-dependent differences were found in regional expression of NMDAR subunits and markers of glutamatergic, GABAergic, and monoaminergic systems. Activated microglia and C1q elevations were found in both juvenile- and adult-T. gondii infected mice.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, risedronate gastrointestinal absorption is dependent on the site and rate of administration. In study A, no statistically significant site-specific differences in any pharmacokinetic parameter were observed, indicating that the extent of risedronate absorption did not differ significantly following administration to the stomach, second part of the duodenum, or terminal ileum. However, in study B, the extent of risedronate absorption did differ significantly following a rapid or a slow infusion, with the area under the serum concentration-time profile and the amount of drug excreted in the urine unchanged. Therefore, the rate of administration also affects the extent of risedronate absorption.",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, high body mass index (BMI) is associated with increased diurnal strains in the articular cartilage of the knee. Subjects with high BMI had significantly thicker cartilage on both the patella and femoral groove, as compared to subjects with normal BMI. Diurnal cartilage strains were dependent on location in the knee joint, as well as BMI. Subjects with high BMI, compared to those with normal BMI, exhibited significantly higher compressive strains in the tibial cartilage. Cartilage thickness on both femoral condyles decreased significantly from the AM to the PM time point; however, there was no significant effect of BMI on diurnal cartilage strain in the femur.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, corticosterone is involved in electroacupuncture-produced anti-edema in a rat model of inflammation. Electroacupuncture (EA) significantly increased plasma corticosterone levels 2 hours and 5 hours after complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) administration compared to sham EA control. Adrenalectomy blocked EA-produced anti-edema, but not EA anti-hyperalgesia. RU486, a prototypical glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, also prevented EA anti-edema.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the study suggests that soluble oncoprotein 185HER-2 in pleural fluid has limited usefulness for the diagnostic evaluation of malignant effusions. The sensitivity of pleural sp185(HER-2) levels greater than 25 ng/mL for predicting a malignant effusion is only 7%, and adding sp185(HER-2) to a panel of CEA and CA 15-3 only nonsignificantly increased sensitivity by 5%. Additionally, only 1 patient with breast adenocarcinoma among 45 cytology-negative malignant effusions had sp185(HER-2) above the diagnostic cutoff point.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, the study did not investigate the effects of Bevacizumab on mitochondria isolated from human brain tumors. The study only investigated the direct effects of Temozolomide and Bevacizumab on mitochondria function and compared these effects on mitochondria isolated from low- and high-grade human brain tumors.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study found no difference in diurnal urine regulation between genders. However, the study did find a trend towards a higher reabsorption of free water in males and a higher excretion of prostaglandin E2 in males.

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, adherence to the 2006 American Heart Association Diet and Lifestyle Recommendations (AHA-DLR) is associated with bone health in older Puerto Ricans. A cross-sectional study of 933 Puerto Ricans aged 47-79 y was conducted to test the association of the AHA-DLS (American Heart Association Diet and Lifestyle Score) with bone health. Bone mineral density (BMD) at the femoral neck, trochanter, total hip, and lumbar spine (L2-L4) was measured by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The results showed that higher AHA-DLS scores were associated with higher BMD at all bone sites.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, basophils are recruited to inflamed lungs in mice and humans and exacerbate memory Th2 responses. This is supported by several studies that have shown that basophils accumulate in the lungs of OVA-immunized mice and adoptively transferred basophils enhance lung IL-4 and IL-13 release. Additionally, basophils have been shown to interact with lung CD4 effectors in the absence of DCs to increase T cell survival and Th2 cytokine expression at the single cell level. Furthermore, basophils have been shown to augment in vitro IL-4 expression in effector memory CD4 T cells that include CRTH2(+) cells through IL-4 and TCR-independent pathways. Finally, basophils have been shown to function as antigen-presenting cells (APC) inducing Th2-mediated immune responses against parasites or protease allergens in mice and humans.",

The study only investigated the effects of beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate supplementation on metabolic parameters in both subcutaneous and intraperitoneal Walker 256 tumor models, but did not assess its effects on tumor growth or survival.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, nT-ProBNP predicts rhythm stability after cardioversion of lone atrial fibrillation. The study found that patients with lone AF who had a significant decrease in nT-ProBNP serum levels after cardioversion were more likely to maintain sinus rhythm during follow-up. Additionally, an optimal cutpoint for nT-ProBNP at 500 ng/L predicted AF recurrence after cardioversion.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, dietary creatine supplementation does not affect haematological indices, indices of muscle damage, hepatic function, or renal function.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the cAMP effectors Epac and PKA are involved in the hepatic cystogenesis of an animal model of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease ( ARPKD ). The study found that Epac isoforms and PKA RIbeta subunit were overexpressed in cultured PCK cholangiocytes, and that both normal and PCK cholangiocytes increase their growth upon Epac-specific stimulation, while PKA-specific stimulation results in increased growth.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, chronic administration of atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone and clozapine can improve behavioral and synaptic defects of STOP null mice. Risperidone and clozapine have been shown to alleviate behavioral alterations mimicking some negative symptoms and partially ameliorate some cognitive defects in STOP null mice. Additionally, clozapine treatment has been shown to improve synaptic plasticity of the STOP null animals by restoring long-term potentiation in the hippocampus.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, chlamydia pneumoniae has been associated with atherosclerotic plaque behavior in patients with established carotid artery stenosis. The presence of C pneumoniae in atherosclerotic plaques has been identified, and elevated titers of antibodies and circulating immune complexes to C pneumoniae have been associated with ultrasound findings indicating presence of atherosclerosis in the carotid artery. Additionally, studies have shown that C pneumoniae infection can lead to increased thrombotic arterial occlusions and atherothrombotic emboli dislodging from an unstable carotid plaque. However, it is unclear whether infection has a genuinely etiologic role in atherosclerosis and whether its presence influences clinical outcomes. Further research is needed to clarify the role of C pneumoniae in atherosclerotic plaque behavior and its impact on clinical outcomes.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, moxibustion activates mast cell degranulation at the ST25 in rats with colitis.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, optic nerve blood flow is diminished in eyes of primary open-angle glaucoma suspects. This was found in a study that used laser Doppler flowmetry to measure blood flow in the optic nerve head of 21 eyes (21 patients) suspected of having primary open-angle glaucoma, compared with a previously reported cohort of 22 eyes (22 patients) with primary open-angle glaucoma and 15 eyes (15 subjects) of age-matched controls. The main outcome measure was the mean flow from the superotemporal rim, inferotemporal rim, and cup, which was calculated and compared between the three groups. The study found that primary open-angle glaucoma suspect eyes had significantly lower mean flow from the superotemporal rim, inferotemporal rim, and cup compared to controls and eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma."

We also report an abnormally high level of matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) in the auditory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice and that deletion of Mmp-9 from Fmr1 KO mice reverses habituation deficits. These data provide a translation relevant electrophysiological biomarker for sensory deficits in FXS and implicate MMP-9 as a target for drug discovery.",
      "Prevalence of hay fever and sinusitis are correlated with air quality. Improvements in air quality are associated with decreased prevalence of both hay fever and sinusitis. Laryngoscope, 2009.",
      "S 23521 is an effective glucagon-like peptide-1-(7-36) amide analogue, which induced a decrease in energy intake, body weight, and adiposity in a rat model of diet-induced obesity. In addition, the treatment also improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity of obese rats. These results strongly support S 23521 as a putative molecule for the treatment of obesity.",
      "Our study demonstrates that the age at first exposure to T. gondii is an important factor in shaping distinct behavioral and neurobiological abnormalities. Elevation in GLUN2 autoantibodies or complement protein C1q may be a potential underlying mechanism. A better understanding of these age-related differences may lead to more efficient treatments of behavioral disorders associated with T. gondii infection.",
      "These studies indicate that the rate and extent of risedronate absorption are independent of the site of administration along the gastrointestinal tract, and that the extent of absorption is not affected by the rate of administration.",
      "These findings indicate that NGAL reduces apoptosis by regulating the four apoptosis factors Bcl-2, Bax, Fas and FasL through its two receptors 24p3R and megalin. These results also suggest that ectopic expression of NGAL in renal cells might provide a therapeutic strategy in ischemia-reperfusion by reducing apoptosis and promoting renal cell proliferation.",
      "Increased BMI is associated with increased diurnal strains in articular cartilage of both the medial and lateral compartments of the knee. The increased cartilage strains observed in individuals with high BMI may, in part, explain the elevated risk of OA associated with obesity or may reflect alterations in the cartilage mechanical properties in subjects with high BMI.",
      "The data demonstrate that EA activates the adrenals to increase plasma corticosterone levels and suppress edema and suggest that EA effects differ in healthy subjects and in those with pathologies.",
      "Measurement of pleural fluid sp185(HER-2) has poor diagnostic performance in patients with malignant effusions.",
      "TMZ and BEV can directly cause the dysfunction of mitochondria isolated from human brain tumors. However, BEV has a greater ability to disturb mitochondrial function in mitochondria isolated from human brain tumors than either TMZ or calcium overload conditions.",
      "Similar urinary flows and osmolalities are associated with levels of plasma vasopressin and renal PGE2, which are higher in males than in females. Oxytocin does not seem to play a role in the diurnal urine formation, whereas prostaglandin E2 could represent a mediator of the gender difference, not only as a mediator of the vasopressin response, but also as an independent factor. These findings need further elucidation.",
      "MICR has a very transient impact on plasma levels of endostatin and no impact on angiostatin during the first 21 days following surgery. Thus, angiostatin and endostatin do not likely contribute to or inhibit the persistent proangiogenic changes noted after MICR.",
      "Dietary guidelines for CVD risk reduction may also benefit bone health in this Hispanic cohort. Synchronizing dietary guidelines for these 2 common diseases may provide a simplified public health message. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01231958.",
      "Basophils may worsen Th2 inflammatory disorders through direct interactions with pathogenic CD4 T cells as well as by enhancing DC-induced Th2 cell development.",
      "We conclude that inhibition of TLR4 with eritoran in an in situ murine model significantly reduces MI/R injury and markers of an inflammatory response.",
      "HMbeta supplementation can increase survival time and promotes metabolic changes in cancer-bearing animals, but it seems to work in a time-dependent manner.",
      "The probability of a successful cardioversion correlates inversely with NT-proBNP values. The short-term success of a cardioversion might be predicted by prior determination of NT-proBNP.",
      "These data provide evidence that there are no obvious adverse effects of acute or more chronic Cr supplementation on the haematological indices measured, nor on hepatic, muscle, and renal function. Therefore there is no apparent health risk associated with Cr supplementation to healthy people when it is ingested in quantities that have been scientifically proven to increase muscle Cr stores.",
      "Our data provide strong evidence that both cAMP effectors, Epac and PKA, and the levels of intracellular calcium are involved in the hepatic cystogenesis of ARPKD.",
      "All together, the pharmacological reactivity of STOP null mice to antipsychotics evokes the pharmacological response of humans to such drugs. Totally, our study suggests that STOP null mice may provide a useful preclinical model to evaluate pharmacological properties of antipsychotic drugs.",
      "This study confirms that C pneumoniae is a common finding in atherosclerotic plaques of the carotid artery but suggests that the presence of the infectious organism has little detectable impact on plaque instability when measured by clinically significant markers. This raises important questions for the rationale of antibiotic therapy in atherosclerosis.",
      "Moxibustion exerted its effect on healing impaired colonic mucosa in rats with TNBS-induced colitis by increasing the degranulation ratio of local MC, but had little effect on the morphology of MC at ST25 acupoint.",
      "Laser Doppler flowmetry detected circulatory abnormalities in primary open-angle glaucoma suspects who did not have any manifest visual field defect. Decreases in flow in glaucoma suspects were similar in magnitude to those of subjects with primary open-angle glaucoma. These data suggest that impaired optic nerve blood flow develops early in the glaucomatous process and does not develop solely as a result of glaucoma damage."
