    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, soluble ( Pro ) Renin Receptor is a predictor of gestational diabetes mellitus. It has been shown that the circulating Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) is activated during normal pregnancy, but little is known about RAS in pregnancies complicated by gestational diabetes (GDM). The aim of this study was to evaluate the circulating RAS profile in normotensive women with GDM at the third trimester of pregnancy and to compare the results with healthy pregnant and non-pregnant age-matched women.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, obvious emphysema on computed tomography during an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) is associated with a poor prognosis. This is based on a study that recorded histories and acquired CT images for 106 patients who visited the emergency department for an AECOPD. Emphysematous change was quantified by measuring the percentage of low-attenuation areas (LAA%) in the entire lung on CT images with a threshold of -950 Hounsfield units. Other factors that could influence AECOPD prognosis were also recorded on admission and analysed. At follow ups conducted in 1 year, patient survival, the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnoea Scale, and performance status (PS) were evaluated, and a COPD Assessment Test (CAT) was completed. The study aimed to study the relationship between prognosis and emphysematous changes on CT during an AECOPD.",
    "\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe provided context discusses several studies that compare chemokine expression patterns in the systemic and genital tract compartments between HIV-1-infected and HIV-1-uninfected women. However, none of these studies specifically investigate the association between chemokine expression patterns and HIV-1 infection in women from Benin. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer based on the provided context.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, pathological observation of lung injury in experimental animals induced by non-ferrous metal ( tin ) dust was performed.\n\nExplanation: The provided context includes several documents that describe pathological observations of lung injury in experimental animals induced by tin dust. For example, in one document, it is stated that \"on the 30th day after exposure to tin dusts, the scattered hoar tip size of the spots in surface and section of the lungs were observed, the scattered focal granulomatous inflammation around the small bronchi and dust particles in lung tissue were observed under microscope; on the 90th day after exposure to tin dusts, the granulomatous inflammation increase, the fibroblasts proliferation, collagen fibers formation and positive VG staining were found. There were significant differences, as compared with positive or negative controls (P < 0.05). These pathological changes were basically the characters of specific pathological changes in early tin pneumoconiosis.\"",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the DNA methylation of the retinoid acid receptor beta (RARbeta), cellular retinol-binding protein 1 (CRBP1), and tazarotene-induced gene 1 (TIG1) genes was analyzed in 42 samples of gastric carcinoma (GC) from 42 patients and in 8 GC cell lines by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. The mRNA expression levels for these three genes were measured by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. In 7 of 8 GC cell lines, the CRBP1 gene was hypermethylated, and CRBP1 transcription was inactive. In 6 of 8 GC cell lines, the TIG1 gene was hypermethylated, and TIG1 transcription was inactive. Treatment with demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restored both CRBP1 and TIG1 transcription. DNA methylation of the RARbeta, CRBP1, and TIG1 genes was detected in 15 of 42 GC samples (36%), 14 of 42 GC samples (33%), and 4 of 42 GC samples (10%), respectively, and in 6 of 30 samples (2",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, antiangiogenic therapy of cerebral melanoma metastases does not result in sustained tumor progression via vessel co-option. The study showed that antiangiogenic treatment inhibits the progression of leptomeningeal tumors.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, clove and eugenol in noncytotoxic concentrations exert immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory action on cytokine production by murine macrophages. Clove (100\u00b5g/well) inhibited IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-10 production and exerted an efficient action either before or after LPS challenge for all cytokines. Eugenol did not affect IL-1\u03b2 production but inhibited IL-6 and IL-10 production. The action of eugenol (50 or 100\u00b5g/well) on IL-6 production prevented efficiently effects of LPS either before or after its addition, whereas on IL-10 production it counteracted significantly LPS action when added after LPS incubation.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, pretreatment with stellate ganglion blockade before ischemia does not reduce infarct size in rat hearts.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, lipidomics reveals multiple pathway effects of a multi-components preparation on lipid biochemistry in ApoE*3Leiden.CETP mice. The preparation SUB885C caused significant reductions in plasma cholesterol, CETP levels, CETP activity, and increased HDL-C. It influenced lipidomics classes of cholesterol esters and triglycerides the most. In vitro, SUB885C extract caused adipolysis stimulation and adipogenesis inhibition in 3T3-L1 cells.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The provided context does not mention any correlation between elevated nm23 protein expression and diminished progression-free survival in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, leukotriene B(4) enhances tumour necrosis factor-alpha-induced CCL27 production in human keratinocytes.",
    "\n\nAnswer: There is some evidence to suggest that hemoglobin levels may have an impact on the tumor response in external-beam radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer. However, there is limited information available on whether this association exists in the context of neoadjuvant androgen-suppression therapy and external-beam radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer. Further research is needed to determine the predictive value of hemoglobin levels for biochemical outcome in this specific treatment setting.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The provided context does not directly address the question about the impact of non-esterified fatty acids on insulin-mediated glucose uptake and disposition in the liver. However, it does mention that non-esterified fatty acids were associated with fatty liver and that whole-body glucose disposal was inversely associated with fatty liver. Additionally, it mentions that NEFA suppression during the OGTT was decreased and the insulin sensitivity index for NEFA was decreased in subjects with fatty liver. These findings suggest that non-esterified fatty acids may play a role in the development of fatty liver and may impair insulin-mediated glucose uptake and disposition in the liver. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings and to better understand the mechanisms underlying the relationship between non-esterified fatty acids and insulin-mediated glucose uptake and disposition in the liver.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, induction of oral tolerance to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) attenuated the initiation and progression of atherogenesis in LDL receptor-/- mice fed a Western-type diet. This was shown by a significant increase in CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ cells in spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes, and these cells specifically responded to oxLDL with increased transforming growth factor-beta production. Additionally, tolerance to oxLDL increased the mRNA expression of Foxp3, CTLA-4, and CD25 in the plaque. In contrast, tolerance to malondialdehyde-treated LDL (MDA-LDL) did not affect atherogenesis.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, a more atherogenic cholesterol distribution by insulin resistance was seen in women with type 1 diabetes.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, options in pediatric glaucoma after angle surgery have failed.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The present study tested the hypothesis that rosuvastatin treatment may attenuate left ventricular (LV) remodelling and dysfunction in the failing heart, which may be associated with alterations of Ca(2+)-regulatory protein. The study investigated the change of LV remodelling and function in a rat model of cardiac dysfunction due to myocardial infarction (MI) with or without rosuvastatin (10 mg/kg/day) treatment for 10 weeks. The protein expression of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA)2a, phospholamban (PLB), and phospho-PLB at serine-16 (pSer16-PLB), as well as SERCA activity, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-10 levels were evaluated. After rosuvastatin treatment, LV remodelling and dysfunction were prevented. Rosuvastatin prevented the decrease of SERCA2a and pSer16-PLB expression, increased SERCA activity, but showed no effect on PLB expression. Furthermore, rosuvastatin reduced the increased IL-6 level and further elevated IL-10 level in the peri-infarct and remote zones of MI. Serum lipid levels remained unchanged",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, prolonged resuscitation of metabolic acidosis after trauma is associated with more complications. In the study, morbidly obese patients with persistent metabolic acidosis developed MOF at a significantly greater rate than did normal weight patients with or without persistent metabolic acidosis. Additionally, in patients with successful resuscitation and controlled ICP, within 72 h of trauma, 76% had low glucose, 93% had elevated LPR, and 74% were in metabolic crisis. The duration of metabolic crisis was longer in those patients with unfavorable (GOSe \u2264 6) versus favorable (GOSe \u2265 7) outcome at 6 months. In four multivariate models, the burden of metabolic crisis was a powerful independent predictor of poor outcome.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, NSC23925 has been shown to prevent the development of multidrug resistance in osteosarcoma cells in vitro. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of NSC23925 on the prevention of multidrug resistance in ovarian cancer, especially in vivo.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, restoration of klotho expression induces apoptosis and autophagy in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, leukocytosis is proportional to HELLP syndrome severity. The study found that patients with class I HELLP syndrome had significantly higher WBC counts than patients with other classes of HELLP syndrome. Additionally, the WBC counts were significantly higher in patients with HELLP syndrome than in patients with severe preeclampsia alone. This suggests that there is an inflammatory component to HELLP syndrome that leads to an increase in leukocyte counts.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, high DcR3 expression was associated with high-grade and high-stage renal cell carcinomas (RCCs). The incidence of distant metastasis and lymph node metastasis was significantly higher in the group with high DcR3 expression. Decoy receptor 3 expression correlated negatively with disease-specific survival and progression-free survival in univariate analyses. A multivariate Cox regression analysis retained DcR3 expression as an independent prognostic factor that outperformed the Karnofsky performance status. In patients with high-stage RCCs expressing DcR3, the 2-year survival probability was 25%, whereas in patients with DcR3-negative tumors, the survival probability was 65% (P <.001). Moreover, DcR3 serum levels were significantly higher in patients with high-stage localized disease and metastatic disease.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, a Multi-Component Prime-Boost Vaccination Regimen with a Consensus MOMP Antigen enhances Chlamydia trachomatis Clearance. The DNA-HuAd5-MVA-Protein vaccine regimen induced a cellular response with a Th1-biased serum antibody response, alongside high serum and vaginal MOMP-specific antibodies. This regimen significantly enhanced clearance against intravaginal C. trachomatis serovar D infection in both BALB/c and B6C3F1 mouse strains. This enhanced clearance was shown to be CD4(+) T-cell dependent.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the angiotensin II type 2 receptor agonist Compound 21 (C21) has been shown to be protective in an experimental model of diabetes-associated atherosclerosis (DAA). This study is the first to investigate the role of C21 in DAA and found that direct stimulation of the AT2R by C21 might contribute to possible insulin-sensitizing/anti-diabetic effects in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) with PPAR\u03b3 activation, mainly focusing on adipose tissue. The results suggest that C21 may have a protective role in DAA.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, fitness and adiposity are independently associated with cardiometabolic risk in youth.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe context provides several documents that discuss the association between fitness and adiposity with cardiometabolic risk in youth. For example, one document examines the independent associations of muscle fitness and cardiorespiratory fitness with clustered metabolic risk in youth. Another document explores whether socio-economic differences exist in cardiometabolic risk markers in children and whether lifestyle-related factors potentially mediate these differences.\n\nThe background context also provides evidence that fitness and adiposity are independently associated with cardiometabolic risk in youth. For example, a study of 450 obese children and adolescents found that increased serum LDL-C, RBP4 and IR(HOMA) were significant independent risk factors associated with obesity. Among children with higher RBP4, the association with obesity increased significantly in the presence of insulin resistance, when compared to higher RBP4 and non-insulin resistance.\n\nOverall, the context and background context provide evidence that fitness and adiposity are independently associated with cardiometabolic risk in youth.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, patient-prosthesis mismatch in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement can affect survival. In patients with aortic stenosis/mixed disease with left ventricular dysfunction, prosthesis-patient mismatch predicted heart failure symptoms by 3 years after aortic valve replacement. Moderate or severe mismatch was a significant predictor of poorer survival, even after adjustment for all significant clinical predictors.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, lifetime sport and leisure activity participation is associated with greater bone size, quality and strength in older men. The study found that a high frequency of competitive sports early in life is associated with BMD at several bone sites, indicating that increases in BMD following PA are preserved longer than previously believed. Additionally, higher sport activity was statistically significantly associated with greater BMD at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip. More home physical activity was associated with higher BMD at the spine and femoral neck.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, hemizygous deletion of CTGF/CCN2 does not suffice to prevent fibrosis of the severely injured kidney. The study examined the effects of CCN2 haploinsufficiency on the progression of renal scarring in long-term STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy, in a more advanced stage of obstructive nephropathy following unilateral ureteric obstruction (UUO), and in severe aristolochic acid (AA)-induced tubulotoxic nephritis. The results showed that CCN2 haploinsufficiency did not prevent fibrosis of the severely injured kidney.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, severity of hepatic encephalopathy before liver transplantation is associated with quality of life after transplantation. This is because hepatic encephalopathy has a negative impact on health-related quality of life (QoL) in liver cirrhosis, and it has been observed that overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is accompanied by a persistent cognitive defect, suggesting that HE may not be fully reversible. The health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) has been shown to be impaired by cirrhosis, and, according to some reports, influenced by minimal HE. Therefore, it is likely that the severity of hepatic encephalopathy before liver transplantation will have a lasting impact on the quality of life of the patient after transplantation.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, sutureless securement device, StatLock, has been demonstrated to significantly reduce catheter-related complications when compared to tape. In a study, 170 patients requiring PICCs were randomized to suture or StatLock securement and were prospectively studied. Patients were followed throughout their entire catheter course, and PICC-related complications including dislodgment, infection, occlusion, leakage, and central venous thrombosis were documented. Catheter outcome data were compared to determine if statistically significant differences existed between the suture and StatLock groups. The results showed that StatLock significantly reduced catheter-related complications when compared to suture.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, attachment of synovial fibroblasts (SFs) to laminin-111 (LM-111) facilitates transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta)-induced expression of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) in SFs. Incubation of SFs on LM-111 in the presence of TGFbeta induced a significant 12-fold higher expression of MMP-3 mRNA, and secretion of MMP-3 was elevated 20-fold above controls. Functional blocking of LM-111-integrin interaction reduced the laminin-activated MMP-3 expression significantly.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, functional health literacy is associated with health status and health-related knowledge in people living with HIV-AIDS. A study conducted among patients seen at an inner-city, public hospital urgent care center found that patients with lower health literacy had lower CD4 cell counts, higher viral loads, were less likely to be taking antiretroviral medications, reported a greater number of hospitalizations, and reported poorer health than those with higher health literacy. In addition, lower health literacy was associated with poorer knowledge of one's HIV-related health status, poorer AIDS-related disease and treatment knowledge, and more negative health care perceptions and experiences.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, trans-aortic Alfieri stitch is placed in the mitral valve through the aortotomy while performing septal myectomy for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, computer-assisted instruction (CAI) tutorial program can improve clinical reasoning skills of dietetics students. The effects of a CAI tutorial program on learning clinical reasoning skills were compared in undergraduate dietetics students. Scores on the simulation test were compared and variables included type of CAI, dietetics program, year in school, computer experience, and experience using a medical chart. Mastery of objectives related to lower- and higher-level clinical reasoning skills introduced in the tutorial program was computed.\n\nAnother study evaluated the efficacy of computer-tailored nutrition education with objective outcome measures. The study found that computer-tailored nutrition education improved clinical reasoning skills of dietetics students.\n\nIn addition, a theory-based, Internet-delivered nutrition education module was evaluated. Cognitive elements of the clinical reasoning process present within students' discussions were compared before and after the introduction of a structured framework to guide discussions. Students' self reports of clinical reasoning skills were also analyzed before and after two consecutive fieldwork placements. The results showed that the structured framework improved clinical reasoning skills of dietetics students.\n\nOverall, these studies suggest that computer-assisted instruction can improve clinical reasoning skills of dietetics students.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study found no significant effects of soy protein isolates of varied isoflavone content on circulating thyroid hormones in healthy young men.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, immunity to blood stages of Plasmodium falciparum is dependent on a specific pattern of immunoglobulin subclass responses to multiple blood stage antigens. This hypothesis results from previous studies showing that IgG1 and IgG3 responses against antigens like ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigens, merozoite surface proteins and variant surface antigens on schizonts were associated with clinical immunity against malaria. None of the specific responses against a single antigen was completely protective.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, recombination pattern reanalysis of some HIV-1 circulating recombination forms (CRFs) suggests the necessity and difficulty of revision. The current study was based on multiple recombination analysis, which may have produced more impartial results. The analysis of a representative set of HIV type 1 (HIV-1) subtype B pol sequences from 5700 patients enrolled in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, pooled with the same number of sequences from foreign epidemics, inferred a phylogeny, and identified Swiss transmission clusters as clades having a minimal size of 10 and containing >or=80% Swiss sequences. The results of this study suggest that recombination pattern reanalysis of some HIV-1 circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) may be necessary and difficult.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, osteopontin (OPN) has been identified as the most highly upregulated factor early after neonatal cerebral hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury. The present study was performed to determine the spatial and temporal expression of OPN and its integrin receptor alpha(v)beta3 during formation of the peri-infarct gliotic barrier and subsequent formation of a new glial-limiting membrane. The study found that OPN plays a critical role in the formation of the peri-infarct gliotic barrier and subsequent formation of a new glial-limiting membrane. Additionally, recombinant OPN (rOPN) has been reported to be neuroprotective in stroke animal models, suggesting that OPN may enhance endogenous repair after neonatal HI brain injury.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, xenon pretreatment attenuates anesthetic-induced apoptosis in the developing brain in comparison with nitrous oxide and hypoxia.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, p130 plays a role in TGF-beta-induced cell-cycle arrest in Rb mutant HT-3 cells. The study found that TGF-beta markedly enhanced the binding of p21 with cdk2 but decreased that of cdk2 with cyclin E and inhibited the phosphorylation of p130. Additionally, E2F-1 protein level was lower in TGF-beta-treated cells, which might be the result of enhanced binding between E2F-4 and p130.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, past cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3, obesity, and earlier menopause are associated with an increased risk of vulval cancer in postmenopausal women.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, severity of coronary artery disease is correlated to cerebrovascular reactivity, but degree of coronary stenosis is not.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study found no significant differences in family satisfaction between conventional rounds and family-centered multidisciplinary rounds. However, the study did find that family-centered multidisciplinary rounds were associated with better understanding of the patients' medical plans, better ability to help the families, and a greater sense of teamwork among hospital staff compared with conventional rounds. Additionally, the study found that family-centered multidisciplinary rounds required an additional 2.7 minutes per patient during rounds. With family-centered multidisciplinary rounds, the family affected the medical decision-making discussion in 90% of cases.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, high doses of ethylene diurea ( EDU ) were not toxic to willow and did not affect the C content and distribution within the plant body. However, EDU did increase the leaf N content. Additionally, EDU was not found to be a nitrogen fertilizer as it did not affect the C content and distribution within the plant body.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, high maternal body mass index increases the risk of neonatal early onset group B streptococcal disease. In obese parturients with BMI > 30, there was an 80% increased risk for verified neonatal EOGBS disease (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.0). When cases with clinical sepsis were included a significant risk increment was also found in overweight women with BMI 25.0-29.9 (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.0).",
    "\n\nAnswer: The provided context does not mention anything about caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) decreasing acute pneumonitis after irradiation in vitro and in vivo. However, it does mention that CAPE induces apoptosis and increases radiosensitivity in lung cancer, and that it could be a useful adjuvant agent for lung cancer treatment. Additionally, it mentions that CAPE has a radiosensitizing effect and can deplete glutathione (GSH), but does not mention anything about its effect on acute pneumonitis.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study investigated the effects of early thymoglobulin administration on cardiocyte nuclear status in orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) recipients. The study evaluated endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs) from 31 OHT recipients and 10 control cases. OHT patients were divided into the standard group who were treated without thymoglobulin; an ATG group who received thymoglobulin electively, and a standard+ATG group who were administered thymoglobulin upon a drop in renal function. The study evaluated only EMBs obtained at 1 and 4 weeks after OHT showing no significant rejection (ISHLT grades 0 to 1B). The morphometric studies were performed using a computerized, automated Quantimet image analysis system. The study found that there was no significant difference in the area, length, breadth, perimeter, chromatin median grey level, and fullness factor between the standard group, the ATG group, and the standard+ATG group. Therefore, the study suggests that thymoglobulin administered early after heart transplantation does not reduce early myocardial hypertrophy assessed by morphometric studies.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, dNA-PKcs expression was found to be a predictor of biochemical recurrence after permanent Iodine 125 interstitial brachytherapy for prostate cancer. This was determined through univariable and multivariable Cox-regression analyses, which evaluated the association of ERG and PTEN status with biochemical recurrence (BCR). In the multivariate analysis, only dNA-PKcs and clinical stage remained predictive of recurrence. Additionally, positive dNA-PKcs nuclear staining was closely associated with biochemical recurrence.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, according to the provided context, chemotherapy for cancer caused apoptosis that preceded hypoplasia in crypts of the small intestine in humans. The document states that \"Apoptosis increased sevenfold in intestinal crypts at one day, and villus area, crypt length, mitotic count per crypt, and enterocyte height decreased at three days after chemotherapy. Disaccharidase activities remained unchanged. Electron microscopy showed increased open tight junctions of enterocytes at day 3, consistent with more immature cells. All indices improved by 16 days.\"",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, alveolar macrophage gene expression is altered in the setting of alcohol use disorders. Whole genome microarray analysis was performed on alveolar macrophages obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage from a test cohort of subjects with AUDs (n = 7), and controls (n = 7) who were pair-matched on age, gender, and smoking. Probe set expression differences in this cohort were validated by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT RT-PCR). Functional analysis with web-based bioinformatics tools was utilized with microarray data to assess differentially expressed candidate genes (p < 0.01) based on alcohol consumption. Alveolar macrophage mRNA samples from a second cohort of subjects with AUDs (n = 7) and controls (n = 7) were used to confirm gene expression differences related to AUDs.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, a diminished postnatal surge of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants is not additional evidence for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The study found that the number of Ad spermatogonia in unilateral cryptorchid testes correlated in a nonlinear fashion with those in the contralateral scrotal testes, indicating that the development of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants is not affected by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, female children were nearly three times more likely to be stunted than male children. Households that were food insecure with hunger were also three times more likely than other households to have a stunted child.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, combination therapy with VELCADE and tissue plasminogen activator is neuroprotective in aged rats after stroke and targets microRNA-146a and the toll-like receptor signaling pathway. The present study tested the hypothesis that combination treatment with VELCADE and tissue plasminogen activator modulates the TLR signaling pathway on cerebral vasculature, which leads to neuroprotection in aged rats after stroke. The study found that combination treatment with VELCADE and tissue plasminogen activator blocked stroke- and tPA-potentiated vascular TLR signals, leading to robust reduction of infarct volume compared with respective monotherapies. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis of cerebral endothelial cells isolated by laser capture microdissection revealed that the combination treatment increased miR-l46a levels, which was inversely associated with the reduction of vascular interleukin-1 receptor-activated kinases 1 immunoreactivity. In vitro, fibrin upregulated interleukin-1 receptor-activated kinases 1 and TLR4 expression and downregulated miR-146a on primary human cerebral endothelial cells. VELCADE elevated miR-146 levels and",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, the study found no consistent associations between peak weight velocity (PWV) and spirometric lung function indices at 15 years of age.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, the provided context does not mention anything about the hepato-protective effects of garlic-derived S-allylmercaptocysteine in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in vivo animal model.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the study found that an increasing proportion of time spent performing chest compressions during cardiac arrest on patients with out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia is associated with a higher likelihood of survival to hospital discharge. The odds ratios of surviving to hospital discharge in the 2 highest categories of chest compression fraction compared with the reference category were 3.01 (95% confidence interval 1.37 to 6.58) and 2.33 (95% confidence interval 0.96 to 5.63).",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, expression of snail in pancreatic cancer promotes metastasis and chemoresistance. In pancreatic cancer, snail expression was found to be expressed in 36% of samples and had a close correlation with lymph node invasion and distant metastasis. After transfecting snail cDNA into pancreatic cancer cell line Panc-1, it was found that snail triggered overt epithelial to mesenchymal transitions in Panc-1 cells, promoting the invasive ability in vitro. Chemosensitivity of Panc-1 cells to 5-fluorouracil or gemcitabine after snail transfection was assayed by MTT cell proliferation assay, and overexpression of snail enhanced the chemoresistance to 5-fluorouracil of gemcitabine at different dosages. Snail-transfected Panc-1 cells produced more spontaneous metastasis than parental untransfected cells after orthotopically injected into the pancreas of nude mice.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, slug down-regulation by RNA interference inhibits invasion growth in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The provided context does not mention anything about postoperative CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil) ameliorating poor outcomes in women with residual invasive breast cancer after neoadjuvant epirubicin/docetaxel chemotherapy. The context discusses the potential role of postneoadjuvant chemotherapy after taxane-containing neoadjuvant chemotherapy and further prognostic factors that predict outcome in women without pathologic complete remission (pCR). It also mentions a retrospective analysis of a database including 2,302 breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy at The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1980 and 2004, where the overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and local recurrence-free survival were compared for patients with no residual invasive or in situ cancer (pathologic complete response [pCR]) and patients with no residual invasive cancer but persistent in situ disease (pCR+DCIS). However, it does not mention anything about postoperative CMF ameliorating poor outcomes in women with residual invasive breast cancer after neoadjuvant epirubicin/docetaxel chemotherapy.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The WD40 domain is required for LRRK2 neurotoxicity. Removing the WD40 domain prevents complex formation and autophosphorylation, and completely blocks the neurotoxicity of multiple LRRK2 PD mutations.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the hypothesis that inhibition of leukocyte function by administration of monoclonal antibody 60.3 (MoAb 60.3) improves electrophysiological recovery and decreases injury volume following transient focal cerebral ischemia in cats was tested and found to be true.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, prenatal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure during the final 2 weeks of pregnancy can induce schizophrenia-like behavioral symptoms, such as deficits in sensorimotor gating (prepulse inhibition) and impairments in social interactions and exploration, in adult offspring. Additionally, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that in our neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia, decreases in the total number of PV- and GAD67-positive neurons in the medial prefrontal cortices of adult females prenatally exposed to LPS were observed, whereas these immunochemical changes were primarily detected in the hippocampus of males. A decrease in PV-labeled axon terminals of GABA-ergic cells, likely reflecting the perisomatic inhibitory innervation of pyramidal neurons, was observed in the medial prefrontal cortices in both sexes. However, the study did not find any significant effects of prenatal LPS exposure on maternal behavior and male offspring sexual behavior in adulthood.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (AFABP) levels were significantly elevated in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) versus control and correlated with indices of adiposity. AFABP also correlated with indices of subcutaneous rather than visceral fat.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, during gait initiation, people with Alzheimer's disease had greater variability in stride timing (AD CV = 4.65, Control CV = 3.64; p < 0.05, d = 0.71) and double support proportion (AD CV = 9.40, Control CV = 7.62; p < 0.05, d = 0.8) compared to controls.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, pitching biomechanics as a pitcher approaches muscular fatigue during a simulated baseball game. Compared with the initial 2 innings, as a pitcher approached muscular fatigue during the final 2 innings, there was a significant decrease in ball velocity, and the trunk was significantly closer to a vertical position. There were no other significant differences in kinematics or kinetics variables.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the bisphosphonate Pamidronate has been shown to be an intestinal antiinflammatory agent in rat and mouse experimental colitis. In a study, Pamidronate was found to improve chemically induced trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid and dextran sulfate sodium colitis in rats, and this beneficial effect was extended to lymphocyte transfer colitis. Pamidronate has no effect on intestinal epithelial cells in vitro in terms of cytokine/chemokine release, but enhances IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, and IL-10 production by T cells in coculture. Pamidronate also exerts a direct immunomodulatory effect on T cells, favoring Th1 differentiation and impairing Th17 polarization. Another study found that Pamidronate reduces colitis in rodents.",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, pterygium is related to a decrease in corneal endothelial cell density. This was found in a retrospective cross-sectional study where 90 consecutive patients with unilateral primary pterygium were enrolled and their corneal endothelial cell density was measured. The relationship between the percentage of pterygium to cornea and a decrease in the ECD was analyzed and an increase in astigmatism in eyes with pterygium was evaluated for association with decreased ECD using the Pearson correlation test. The study found that lower corneal endothelial cell density values were found in older emmetropic, myopic and hyperopic subjects. A significant correlation between endothelial cell density and age was found in emmetropic, myopic and hyperopic subjects.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, long-term reversal of hypocholesterolaemia in patients with chronic hepatitis C is related to sustained viral response and viral genotype. Genotype-3 of HCV had age-adjusted hypocholesterolaemia and more frequent hepatic steatosis (P < 0.001). Steatosis was inversely correlated with serum cholesterol (P < 0.01) and directly with viral load (P < 0.03). In patients with genotype-3 of HCV and sustained viral response, serum cholesterol increased from 138 (95% CI: 120-151) to 180 mg/dL (95% CI: 171-199) 12 months after treatment conclusion (P < 0.0001). By contrast, cholesterol values were unchanged in genotype-3 of HCV non-responders and in patients with genotype-1 of HCV regardless of response. Rising cholesterol in sustained viral response did not parallel the changes in beta-hydroxybutyrate.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The present study aimed to see if life style interventions/weight reduction could decrease cathepsin L and S levels in blood plasma. However, the provided context does not mention any association between life style interventions and decreased levels of cathepsins L and S in plasma. The context does mention that higher cathepsin S was associated with higher CRP and IL-6 in a community-based sample, but it does not mention any association with life style interventions.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, the results of the study have been inconsistent and the association between the -344C/T polymorphism in the CYP11B2 gene and hypertension risk in the Chinese population has not been confirmed.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, simple and complex alternative splicing patterns may be subject to opposite selection forces for protein reading frame preservation. Simple ASEs have higher FRFPs than CSEs, while complex ASEs have lower FRFPs than CSEs. Conservation of the ASE/CSE splicing pattern increases the FRFPs of simple ASEs but decreases those of complex ASEs.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, high nuclear expression of HDGF correlates with disease progression and poor prognosis in human endometrial carcinoma. A study of 122 endometrial carcinoma patients found that higher expression of nuclear HDGF was associated with T stage (P=0.005) and clinical stage (P=0.038), but there was no association with lymph node or distant metastasis. Patients with increased HDGF expression levels had poorer overall survival rates than those with low expression of HDGF levels (P=0.006). Multivariate analysis revealed that high expression of nuclear HDGF was an independent prognostic indicator of patient survival.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The provided context suggests that 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scanning can be useful in both the initial assessment and follow-up of patients with Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD). In the initial assessment, FDG-PET scanning can help to identify the presence and extent of disease. In the follow-up, FDG-PET scanning can help to monitor changes in the disease and predict clinical outcomes. However, the specific use and utility of FDG-PET scanning in ECD may depend on the specific context and patient population being studied.",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, a genetic deletion of Mmp-9 reverses ERP habituation deficits in Fmr1 KO mice. Although the N1 amplitude of Mmp-9/Fmr1 DKO recordings was larger than WT and KO recordings, the habituation of ERPs in Mmp-9/Fmr1 DKO mice is similar to WT mice implicating MMP-9 as a potential target for reversing sensory processing deficits in FXS.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, air quality influences the prevalence of hay fever and sinusitis. According to the National Health Interview Survey for the calendar years 1997-2006 adult sample, a statistically significant relationship with air quality was obtained for hay fever and sinusitis. The standardized regression coefficient with air quality for hay fever and sinusitis was substantially larger than for the control condition of kidney failure/weakening. The prevalence of allergic rhinitis is also high, but the role of environmental factors remains unclear.",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, anti-NMDA receptor autoantibodies and associated neurobehavioral pathology in mice are dependent on age of first exposure to Toxoplasma gondii. Juvenile mice exhibited decreased pre-pulse inhibition of the acoustic startle (PPI) and greater elevation of GLUN2 autoantibodies compared to adult mice following T. gondii infection. In addition, age-dependent differences were found in regional expression of NMDAR subunits and markers of glutamatergic, GABAergic, and monoaminergic systems. Activated microglia and C1q elevations were also found in both juvenile- and adult-T. gondii infected mice.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, risedronate gastrointestinal absorption is not independent of site and rate of administration. In study A, no statistically significant site-specific differences in any pharmacokinetic parameter were observed.

    "\n\nAnswer: No, the study does not provide evidence that neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) protects renal tubular epithelial cells in hypoxia-reperfusion by reducing apoptosis. The study aims to elucidate the role of NGAL in regulating apoptosis of tubular epithelial cells in a hypoxia-reperfusion model, but it does not provide any evidence to support this claim.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, high body mass index (BMI) is associated with increased diurnal strains in the articular cartilage of the knee. Subjects with high BMI had significantly thicker cartilage on both the patella and femoral groove, as compared to subjects with normal BMI. Diurnal cartilage strains were dependent on location in the knee joint, as well as BMI. Subjects with high BMI, compared to those with normal BMI, exhibited significantly higher compressive strains in the tibial cartilage. Cartilage thickness on both femoral condyles decreased significantly from the AM to the PM time point; however, there was no significant effect of BMI on diurnal cartilage strain in the femur.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The present study investigated the biochemical mechanisms of EA anti-inflammation in a rat model. Experiment 1 measured plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels to see if EA regulates CORT secretion. The results showed that EA treatment significantly decreased plasma CORT levels in the rats. Therefore, it can be concluded that corticosterone may mediate electroacupuncture-produced anti-edema in a rat model of inflammation.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, soluble oncoprotein 185HER-2 in pleural fluid has limited usefulness for the diagnostic evaluation of malignant effusions. Pleural sp185(HER-2) levels greater than 25 ng/mL were observed in 20% of breast and 10% of lung adenocarcinomas, and predicted a malignant effusion with a sensitivity of 7% and a likelihood ratio of 7.6. However, the combination of CEA and CA 15-3 resulted in 50% sensitivity, while adding sp185(HER-2) to this panel nonsignificantly increased sensitivity by 5%. Only 1 patient with breast adenocarcinoma among 45 cytology-negative malignant effusions had sp185(HER-2) above the diagnostic cutoff point. Therefore, soluble oncoprotein 185HER-2 in pleural fluid has limited usefulness for the diagnostic evaluation of malignant effusions.",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, adherence to the 2006 American Heart Association Diet and Lifestyle Recommendations (AHA-DLR) is associated with bone health in older Puerto Ricans. In a cross-sectional study of 933 Puerto Ricans aged 47-79 y, the AHA-DLS was modified to test associations with bone health. Bone mineral density (BMD) at the femoral neck, trochanter, total hip, and lumbar spine (L2-L4) was measured by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The study tested the hypothesis that adherence to the AHA-DLR is associated with bone health. The results showed that those who adhered to the AHA-DLR had significantly higher bone mineral density than those who did not.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, basophils are recruited to inflamed lungs of OVA-immunized mice and humans. Adoptive transfer of basophils to OVA-sensitized hosts enhanced lung IL-4 and IL-13 release while co-administration of OVA further aggravated airway inflammation and Th2 responses in LNs. In vitro studies revealed that pulmonary basophils interacted with lung CD4 effectors, in the absence of DCs, to increase T cell survival and Th2 cytokine expression at the single cell level but amplified OVA-loaded DC-driven Th2 differentiation. Human basophils augmented in vitro IL-4 expression in effector memory CD4 T cells that include CRTH2(+) cells through IL-4 and TCR-independent pathways.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, inhibition of Toll-like receptor 4 with eritoran attenuates myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate supplementation affects Walker 256 tumor-bearing rats in a time-dependent manner. In the study, rats were supplemented with either beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate or saline by gavage for 4 weeks. After the experimental period, the animals were subjected to the glucose tolerance test (GTT) and plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) concentration measurements. The soleus skeletal muscle, liver, and white adipose tissue were removed for molecular (western blotting and RT-PCR) and histological analysis. The results showed that beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate supplementation significantly increased the levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate in the blood of the rats, and also increased the survival time of the rats by approximately 5 days compared to the control group. Additionally, the study found that the effects of beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate supplementation were time-dependent, as the rats that were supplemented with beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate for 4 weeks had a longer survival time than the rats that were supplemented for only 2 weeks.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, nT-ProBNP does not predict rhythm stability after cardioversion of lone atrial fibrillation.",
    "\n\nAnswer:\n\nBased on the provided context, it appears that dietary creatine supplementation may affect some indices of muscle damage and renal function. In the first document, it is mentioned that serum creatinine concentration tended to be increased the day after Cr supplementation, but this increase was probably attributable to increased creatinine production rather than renal dysfunction. Additionally, in the second document, it is stated that no detrimental effects of creatine supplementation on the renal function indices were observed in two-thirds nephrectomized or sham-operated animals. However, it is important to note that the specific effects of creatine supplementation on haematological indices, muscle damage, and hepatic and renal function may vary depending on the individual and the specific context. Therefore, further research is needed to fully understand the potential effects of creatine supplementation on these indices.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, both Epac and PKA are involved in the hepatic cystogenesis of an animal model of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease ( ARPKD ). Epac isoforms and the PKA RIbeta subunit are overexpressed in cultured PCK cholangiocytes. Proliferation analysis in response to Epac and PKA activation indicated that both normal and PCK cholangiocytes increase their growth upon Epac-specific stimulation, while PKA-specific stimulation results in differential effects, suppressing proliferation in normal cholangiocytes but accelerating this process in PCK cholangiocytes.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, chronic administration of atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone and clozapine can improve behavioral and synaptic defects of STOP null mice. Long-term administration of either drug results in alleviation of behavioral alterations mimicking some negative symptoms and partial amelioration of some cognitive defects in STOP null mice. Additionally, clozapine treatment also improves synaptic plasticity of the STOP null animals by restoring long-term potentiation in the hippocampus.",
    "\n\nAnswer:\n\nChlamydia pneumoniae has been associated with atherosclerotic disease, but it is unclear whether its presence influences clinical outcomes and at which stages of disease this occurs. To investigate this issue, researchers used molecular biological detection methods and clinically relevant indicators of pathology in carotid artery atheroma to determine whether the presence of C pneumoniae correlates with plaque instability in patients with advanced carotid artery atherosclerosis.\n\nThe study was designed to clarify whether the association between C pneumoniae and atherosclerotic disease is based on C pneumoniae-induced transformation of a stable into an unstable atherosclerotic plaque or on stimulation of hypercoagulability leading to increased thrombotic arterial occlusions by C pneumoniae infection. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonographic monitoring of the middle cerebral artery during carotid endarterectomy offered the opportunity to study, before removal of the plaque, atherothrombotic emboli dislodging from an unstable carotid plaque (plaque-related emboli) and emboli related to (excessive) thrombus formation at the endarterectomy site after removal of the plaque and restoration of flow (throm",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, moxibustion activates mast cell degranulation at the ST25 in rats with colitis. The study conducted by the authors showed that rats in the moxibustion group, moxibustion plus disodium cromoglycate (M + DC) group and moxibustion plus normal saline (M + NS) group had significantly higher numbers of mast cells in the ST25 acupoint areas compared to the normal group. Additionally, the study also showed that moxibustion plus disodium cromoglycate (M + DC) group had significantly higher numbers of mast cells in the ST25 acupoint areas compared to the moxibustion group. This suggests that moxibustion activates mast cell degranulation at the ST25 in rats with colitis.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, optic nerve blood flow was found to be diminished in primary open-angle glaucoma suspect eyes compared to controls. Specifically, the mean flow from the superotemporal rim, inferotemporal rim, and cup was calculated (Flow(3)) and identified as the main outcome measure. Measurements from primary open-angle glaucoma suspect eyes were compared with corresponding measurements from controls and eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma; a Student t test was employed with a Bonferroni corrected P value of.025 to show that Flow(3) was 24% lower in primary open-angle glaucoma suspect eyes (P <.0003). In primary open-angle glaucoma suspect eyes, flow was 16% lower in the superotemporal rim (P <.007), 35% lower in the cup (P <.007), and 22% lower in the inferotemporal neuroretinal rim (P <.029) compared with controls. No significant difference between primary open-angle glaucoma suspect and control eyes was seen in the inferonasal rim, superonasal rim, or foveola."

Postneoadjuvant chemotherapy showed no discernible benefit even in subgroups with aggressive tumor biology or significant remaining tumor burden. The use of such treatment should therefore be discouraged outside of clinical trials.",
      "These findings suggest that LRRK2 dimerization and autophosphorylation may be required for the neurotoxicity of LRRK2 PD mutations and highlight a potential role for the WD40 domain in the mechanism of LRRK2-mediated cell death.",
      "Inhibition of leukocyte function with MoAb 60.3 does not afford protection from severe focal ischemia and reperfusion in cats.",
      "We propose that prenatal LPS exposure on GD21 acts as an imprinting factor that interferes with the programming of brain sexual determination in offspring.",
      "Circulating AFABP, produced by adipocytes and macrophages, and lipocalin-2, produced by multiple tissues, are elevated and may contribute to the metabolic syndrome in NAFLD. AFABP levels, which correlate with subcutaneous, but not visceral fat, independently predict inflammation and fibrosis in NAFLD and may have a direct pathogenic link to disease progression.",
      "Increased timing variability in people with AD occurs during gait initiation as well as during constant speed walking and is evident in the early disease stages.",
      "The relatively few differences observed imply that pitching biomechanics remained remarkably similar between collegiate starting pitchers who threw between 105 and 135 pitches for 7 to 9 innings and approached muscular fatigue.",
      "Pamidronate presents antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory properties in 3 different models of experimental colitis in rodents. This effect requires oral administration and may involve T cells in the gut mucosa, although the exact mechanism is unclear.",
      "Spatial hearing skills in sequentially implanted children develop in an experience-dependent manner, perhaps because of the ability of the auditory system to use newly acquired electrical stimulation presented to the 2 ears.",
      "We suggest that the combination of GM-CSF with appropriate antibiotics can resolve EG and avoid or minimize the risk of septicemia in immunosuppressed patients.",
      "Pterygium is related to a decrease in corneal ECD. Surgical intervention should be considered in patients with extensive pterygium involvement in the cornea or a significant increase in astigmatism.",
      "Besides causing hepatic steatosis, genotype-3 specifically decreases serum cholesterol. This interference with the metabolic lipid pathway is related to viral load, is reversed with sustained viral response, and seems unrelated to mitochondrial dysfunction.",
      "The intervention program resulted in significant reductions of cathepsin L and S levels in plasma after 4 and 8 weeks of intervention.",
      "The T allele of rs2289105 in CYP19 gene might be a protective genetic marker of EH for women in Han population.",
      "In this study, we find that simple and complex ASEs undergo opposite selection pressure for protein reading frame preservation, with CSEs in-between. Simple ASEs have much higher FRFPs than complex ones. We further find that the FRFPs of complex ASEs coupled with flanking exons are close to those of simple ASEs, indicating that neighboring exons of an ASE may evolve in a coordinated way to avoid protein dysfunction. Therefore, we suggest that evolutionary analyses of AS should take into consideration the effects of different splicing patterns and the joint effects of multiple AS events.",
      "Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that HDGF was expressed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. High nuclear expression of HDGF was positively correlated with FIGO stage (P = 0.032), but not associated with other clinical features, such as histological grading or lymph node status. Patients with high expression of HDGF had poorer overall survival rates than those with low expression of HDGF (P = 0.001). However, multivariate analyses showed that high nuclear expression of HDGF protein was not an independent predictor of prognosis for EC patients (P = 0.111). Our results suggest that high nuclear expression of HDGF is a potential unfavorable factor for the progression and prognosis of EC.",
      "The results of our large, single-center, retrospective study suggest that the findings of a FDG-PET scan may be interesting in the initial assessment of patients with ECD, but its greater contribution is in followup of these patients.",
      "Over expression of UCP2 in certain tumors provides the rationale to speculate that UCP2 may promote tumor growth in these cancers.",
      "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading known genetic cause of autism spectrum disorders. Individuals with FXS show symptoms of auditory hypersensitivity. These symptoms may arise due to sustained neural responses to repeated sounds, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. For the first time, this study shows deficits in habituation of neural responses to repeated sounds in the Fmr1 KO mice as seen in humans with FXS. We also report an abnormally high level of matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) in the auditory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice and that deletion of Mmp-9 from Fmr1 KO mice reverses habituation deficits. These data provide a translation relevant electrophysiological biomarker for sensory deficits in FXS and implicate MMP-9 as a target for drug discovery.",
      "Prevalence of hay fever and sinusitis are correlated with air quality. Improvements in air quality are associated with decreased prevalence of both hay fever and sinusitis. Laryngoscope, 2009.",
      "S 23521 is an effective glucagon-like peptide-1-(7-36) amide analogue, which induced a decrease in energy intake, body weight, and adiposity in a rat model of diet-induced obesity. In addition, the treatment also improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity of obese rats. These results strongly support S 23521 as a putative molecule for the treatment of obesity.",
      "Our study demonstrates that the age at first exposure to T. gondii is an important factor in shaping distinct behavioral and neurobiological abnormalities. Elevation in GLUN2 autoantibodies or complement protein C1q may be a potential underlying mechanism. A better understanding of these age-related differences may lead to more efficient treatments of behavioral disorders associated with T. gondii infection.",
      "These studies indicate that the rate and extent of risedronate absorption are independent of the site of administration along the gastrointestinal tract, and that the extent of absorption is not affected by the rate of administration.",
      "These findings indicate that NGAL reduces apoptosis by regulating the four apoptosis factors Bcl-2, Bax, Fas and FasL through its two receptors 24p3R and megalin. These results also suggest that ectopic expression of NGAL in renal cells might provide a therapeutic strategy in ischemia-reperfusion by reducing apoptosis and promoting renal cell proliferation.",
      "Increased BMI is associated with increased diurnal strains in articular cartilage of both the medial and lateral compartments of the knee. The increased cartilage strains observed in individuals with high BMI may, in part, explain the elevated risk of OA associated with obesity or may reflect alterations in the cartilage mechanical properties in subjects with high BMI.",
      "The data demonstrate that EA activates the adrenals to increase plasma corticosterone levels and suppress edema and suggest that EA effects differ in healthy subjects and in those with pathologies.",
      "Measurement of pleural fluid sp185(HER-2) has poor diagnostic performance in patients with malignant effusions.",
      "TMZ and BEV can directly cause the dysfunction of mitochondria isolated from human brain tumors. However, BEV has a greater ability to disturb mitochondrial function in mitochondria isolated from human brain tumors than either TMZ or calcium overload conditions.",
      "Similar urinary flows and osmolalities are associated with levels of plasma vasopressin and renal PGE2, which are higher in males than in females. Oxytocin does not seem to play a role in the diurnal urine formation, whereas prostaglandin E2 could represent a mediator of the gender difference, not only as a mediator of the vasopressin response, but also as an independent factor. These findings need further elucidation.",
      "MICR has a very transient impact on plasma levels of endostatin and no impact on angiostatin during the first 21 days following surgery. Thus, angiostatin and endostatin do not likely contribute to or inhibit the persistent proangiogenic changes noted after MICR.",
      "Dietary guidelines for CVD risk reduction may also benefit bone health in this Hispanic cohort. Synchronizing dietary guidelines for these 2 common diseases may provide a simplified public health message. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01231958.",
      "Basophils may worsen Th2 inflammatory disorders through direct interactions with pathogenic CD4 T cells as well as by enhancing DC-induced Th2 cell development.",
      "We conclude that inhibition of TLR4 with eritoran in an in situ murine model significantly reduces MI/R injury and markers of an inflammatory response.",
      "HMbeta supplementation can increase survival time and promotes metabolic changes in cancer-bearing animals, but it seems to work in a time-dependent manner.",
      "The probability of a successful cardioversion correlates inversely with NT-proBNP values. The short-term success of a cardioversion might be predicted by prior determination of NT-proBNP.",
      "These data provide evidence that there are no obvious adverse effects of acute or more chronic Cr supplementation on the haematological indices measured, nor on hepatic, muscle, and renal function. Therefore there is no apparent health risk associated with Cr supplementation to healthy people when it is ingested in quantities that have been scientifically proven to increase muscle Cr stores.",
      "Our data provide strong evidence that both cAMP effectors, Epac and PKA, and the levels of intracellular calcium are involved in the hepatic cystogenesis of ARPKD.",
      "All together, the pharmacological reactivity of STOP null mice to antipsychotics evokes the pharmacological response of humans to such drugs. Totally, our study suggests that STOP null mice may provide a useful preclinical model to evaluate pharmacological properties of antipsychotic drugs.",
      "This study confirms that C pneumoniae is a common finding in atherosclerotic plaques of the carotid artery but suggests that the presence of the infectious organism has little detectable impact on plaque instability when measured by clinically significant markers. This raises important questions for the rationale of antibiotic therapy in atherosclerosis.",
      "Moxibustion exerted its effect on healing impaired colonic mucosa in rats with TNBS-induced colitis by increasing the degranulation ratio of local MC, but had little effect on the morphology of MC at ST25 acupoint.",
      "Laser Doppler flowmetry detected circulatory abnormalities in primary open-angle glaucoma suspects who did not have any manifest visual field defect. Decreases in flow in glaucoma suspects were similar in magnitude to those of subjects with primary open-angle glaucoma. These data suggest that impaired optic nerve blood flow develops early in the glaucomatous process and does not develop solely as a result of glaucoma damage."
