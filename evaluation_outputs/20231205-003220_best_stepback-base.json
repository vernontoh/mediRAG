    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is characterized by dynamic impairment of active relaxation and contraction of the left ventricle on exercise and associated with myocardial energy deficiency. This is because HFpEF is a complex condition that involves multiple factors such as myocardial extracellular matrix accumulation, impaired myocardial oxygen delivery, and chronic inflammation. These factors can lead to a reduction in the ability of the left ventricle to relax and contract efficiently, which can result in exercise intolerance and dyspnea. Additionally, HFpEF is often associated with myocardial energy deficiency, which can further exacerbate the symptoms of the condition. Therefore, it is important to understand the underlying mechanisms of HFpEF and develop effective treatments that target these factors to improve the quality of life for patients with this condition.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, soluble ( Pro ) Renin Receptor is a predictor of gestational diabetes mellitus.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, obvious emphysema on computed tomography during an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is associated with a poor prognosis.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the study found that levels of both genital mucosal and blood chemokines were significantly higher in HIV-1-infected women compared to HIV-1-uninfected women. The study also found that chemokine expression patterns in the systemic and genital tract compartments were associated with HIV-1 infection in women from Benin.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the pathological observation of lung injury in experimental animals induced by non-ferrous metal ( tin ) dust has been reported. In rats exposed to tin dusts, on the 30th day after exposure to tin dusts, the scattered hoar tip size of the spots in surface and section of the lungs were observed, the scattered focal granulomatous inflammation around the small bronchi and dust particles in lung tissue were observed under microscope; on the 90th day after exposure to tin dusts, the granulomatous inflammation increase, the fibroblasts proliferation, collagen fibers formation and positive VG staining were found. There were significant differences, as compared with positive or negative controls (P < 0.05). These pathological changes were basically the characters of specific pathological changes in early tin pneumoconiosis.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the DNA methylation of the retinoid acid receptor beta, cellular retinol-binding protein 1, and tazarotene-induced gene 1 genes is associated with expression of these genes in gastric carcinoma.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, antiangiogenic therapy of cerebral melanoma metastases does not result in sustained tumor progression via vessel co-option. The study showed that the PI3K-AKT survival pathway is hyperactivated in brain but not extracerebral melanoma metastases and that astrocyte-conditioned medium activates AKT in melanoma cells in vitro. The PI3K inhibitor buparlisib was tested as an antitumor agent for melanoma brain metastases and was found to be effective in inhibiting tumor growth and progression.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, clove and eugenol in noncytotoxic concentrations exert immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory action on cytokine production by murine macrophages. Clove (100\u00b5g/well) inhibited IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-10 production and exerted an efficient action either before or after LPS challenge for all cytokines. Eugenol did not affect IL-1\u03b2 production but inhibited IL-6 and IL-10 production. The action of eugenol (50 or 100\u00b5g/well) on IL-6 production prevented efficiently effects of LPS either before or after its addition, whereas on IL-10 production it counteracted significantly LPS action when added after LPS incubation.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, pretreatment with stellate ganglion blockade before ischemia reduced infarct size in rat hearts.\n\nExplanation: In the study, ischemic preconditioning was induced by 15 minutes of 2.1 vol% isoflurane. In some experiments, LY294002 (15 microM), a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, was coadministered with isoflurane. Masson's trichrome staining, immunohistochemistry, Western blot analysis, and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction were used to confirm remodeling. In buffer-perfused hearts, functional recovery was recorded, and acute infarct size was measured using 1% triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining and lactate dehydrogenase release during reperfusion. Western blot analysis was used to determine phosphorylation of reperfusion injury salvage kinases including protein kinase B/Akt and its downstream targets after 15 minutes of reperfusion. The results showed that pretreatment with stellate ganglion blockade before ischemia reduced infarct size in rat hearts.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, lipidomics reveals multiple pathway effects of a multi-components preparation on lipid biochemistry in ApoE*3Leiden.CETP mice. The major variance of gene expression profile was not caused by known factors and no significant difference can be directly derived from differential gene expression profile. However, the combination of lipidomic and gene expression analyses allows us to reveal the correlation between the altered lipid profile with significantly enriched pathways, such as one carbon pool by folate, arachidonic acid metabolism, insulin signaling pathway, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, propanoate metabolism, and starch and sucrose metabolism. The genes in these pathways showed a good capability to classify diabetes samples.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, elevated nm23 protein expression is not correlated with diminished progression-free survival in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma. The study found that there was no significant association between nm23 protein expression and progression-free survival in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, leukotriene B ( 4 ) enhances tumour necrosis factor-alpha-induced CCL27 production in human keratinocytes.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, hemoglobin levels do not predict biochemical outcome for localized prostate cancer treated with neoadjuvant androgen-suppression therapy and external-beam radiotherapy.\n\nExplanation: The provided context does not mention any association between hemoglobin levels and biochemical outcome for localized prostate cancer treated with neoadjuvant androgen-suppression therapy and external-beam radiotherapy. The only mention of hemoglobin levels is in the context of external-beam radiotherapy, where it is investigated whether the hemoglobin level could have an impact on the tumor response. However, the provided context does not mention any association between hemoglobin levels and biochemical outcome for localized prostate cancer treated with neoadjuvant androgen-suppression therapy and external-beam radiotherapy.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, non-esterified fatty acids decreased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, insulin content and increased triglyceride content of human isolated islets, independently from the deleterious effect of glucose. Increased glucose concentrations also decreased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and insulin content, but had no influence on triglyceride content. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion of islets appeared to be significantly correlated with their triglyceride content. Glucose and non-esterified fatty acids modified the gene expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, acyl-CoA oxidase and uncoupling protein 2.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, induction of oral tolerance to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) can ameliorate atherosclerosis. This was demonstrated in a study where LDL receptor-/- mice fed a Western-type diet were treated with oxLDL or malondialdehyde-treated LDL (MDA-LDL) before the induction of atherogenesis. Oral tolerance to oxLDL resulted in a significant attenuation of the initiation and progression of atherogenesis. Additionally, tolerance to oxLDL induced a significant increase in CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ cells in spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes, and these cells specifically responded to oxLDL with increased transforming growth factor-beta production. Tolerance to oxLDL also increased the mRNA expression of Foxp3, CTLA-4, and CD25 in the plaque. In contrast, tolerance to MDA-LDL did not affect atherogenesis.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, in women with type 1 diabetes and insulin resistance, a more atherogenic cholesterol distribution by insulin resistance was seen.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, almost 20% of angle procedures eventually fail, and surgeons are confronted with a choice of what procedure to do next: a trabeculectomy with or without adjunctive antifibrosis therapy, glaucoma drainage surgery, or cyclodestructive procedures.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the present study tested the hypothesis that rosuvastatin treatment may attenuate left ventricular (LV) remodelling and dysfunction in the failing heart, which may be associated with alterations of Ca(2+)-regulatory protein. The study found that rosuvastatin prevented the decrease of SERCA2a and pSer16-PLB expression, increased SERCA activity, but showed no effect on PLB expression. Furthermore, rosuvastatin reduced the increased IL-6 level and further elevated IL-10 level in the peri-infarct and remote zones of MI.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, prolonged resuscitation of metabolic acidosis after trauma is associated with more complications. In four multivariate models, the burden of metabolic crisis was a powerful independent predictor of poor outcome.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, NSC23925 has been shown to prevent the development of multidrug resistance in ovarian cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, restoration of klotho expression induces apoptosis and autophagy in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, leukocytosis is proportional to HELLP syndrome severity. The study found that the white blood cell (WBC) counts were significantly higher in patients with HELLP syndrome than in patients with severe preeclampsia alone. Regression analysis showed that platelet counts varied inversely with WBC counts. Also, patients with class I HELLP syndrome had significantly higher WBC counts than patients with other classes of HELLP syndrome. This suggests that there is an inflammatory component to HELLP syndrome, which is characterized by an imbalance of circulating pro- and anti-angiogenic factors. The study also found that thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) levels were altered in preeclampsia and in HELLP syndrome, which further supports the inflammatory nature of the condition.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, DcR3 overexpression correlated with lymph node metastases and TNM stages in pancreatic head carcinoma. The median overall survival for the high DcR3 group was 16.3 months, compared to 21.6 months for the low DcR3 group. In the low DcR3 group, no significant difference was found in the overall survival between patients who underwent standard pancreatoduodenectomy (SPD) and those who had radical pancreatoduodenectomy (RPD). In the high DcR3 group, the median overall survival rates were 16.8 months in the RPD group and 13.5 months in the SPD group.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, a Multi-Component Prime-Boost Vaccination Regimen with a Consensus MOMP Antigen enhances Chlamydia trachomatis Clearance.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe study found that a Multi-Component Prime-Boost Vaccination Regimen with a Consensus MOMP Antigen significantly enhanced clearance against intravaginal C. trachomatis serovar D infection in both BALB/c and B6C3F1 mouse strains. The enhanced clearance was shown to be CD4(+) T-cell dependent.\n\nThe study also found that a Multi-Component Prime-Boost Vaccination Regimen with a Consensus MOMP Antigen induced a cellular response with a Th1-biased serum antibody response, alongside high serum and vaginal MOMP-specific antibodies.\n\nOverall, the study suggests that a Multi-Component Prime-Boost Vaccination Regimen with a Consensus MOMP Antigen is an effective way to enhance Chlamydia trachomatis Clearance.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the angiotensin II type 2 receptor agonist Compound 21 (C21) was found to be protective in experimental diabetes-associated atherosclerosis (DAA) in vivo and in vitro. C21 treatment significantly attenuated aortic plaque deposition in a mouse model of DAA, in association with a decreased infiltration of macrophages and mediators of inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis. On the other hand, combination therapy with C21 and candesartan (AT1R antagonist) appeared to have a limited additive effect in attenuating the pathology of DAA when compared with either treatment alone. Similarly, C21 was found to confer profound anti-atherosclerotic actions at the in vitro level, particularly in the setting of hyperglycaemia. Strikingly, these atheroprotective actions of C21 were completely blocked by the AT2R antagonist PD123319.",
    "\n\nAnswer: It is unclear whether cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is independently linked to cardiometabolic risk in children. This study investigated a) the association between CRF level and presence of cardiometabolic risk disorders using health-related cut points, and b) whether these associations were mediated by abdominal adiposity in children. The strong relation between CRF and adiposity renders their independent associations to metabolic risk factors difficult to ascertain.\n\nTo examine the independent associations of muscular and cardiorespiratory fitness with clustered metabolic risk in adolescents, and to examine the independent associations of muscle fitness and cardiorespiratory fitness with clustered metabolic risk in youth, it is important to consider the context of the study. For example, the study may have used different health-related cut points for CRF and adiposity, or may have focused on different cardiometabolic risk factors. Additionally, the study may have included other factors that could influence the associations between fitness and adiposity, such as diet and physical activity. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the specific context of the study when interpreting the results.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, patient-prosthesis mismatch in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement may affect survival. The study found that moderate or severe patient-prosthesis mismatch was a significant predictor of poorer survival in patients with aortic stenosis/mixed disease who had preoperative left ventricular dysfunction. In contrast, there was no such effect in patients with aortic insufficiency, irrespective of left ventricular function.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the study found that a high frequency of competitive sports early in life was associated with bone mineral density (BMD) at several bone sites, indicating that increases in BMD following PA are preserved longer than previously believed. However, the study did not specifically investigate the association between lifetime sport and leisure activity participation and greater bone size, quality and strength in older men.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study examined the effects of hemizygous deletion of CTGF/CCN2 on the progression of renal scarring in long-term STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy, in a more advanced stage of obstructive nephropathy following unilateral ureteric obstruction (UUO), and in severe aristolochic acid (AA)-induced tubulotoxic nephritis. The results showed that hemizygous deletion of CTGF/CCN2 did not prevent fibrosis of the severely injured kidney.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, severity of hepatic encephalopathy before liver transplantation is associated with quality of life after transplantation. This is because hepatic encephalopathy has a negative impact on health-related quality of life (QoL) in liver cirrhosis.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, sutureless securement device StatLock has been shown to reduce catheter-related complications when compared to tape in a study conducted to evaluate its performance for securement of peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs). The study followed 170 patients requiring PICCs, which were randomized to suture or StatLock securement, and documented PICC-related complications including dislodgment, infection, occlusion, leakage, and central venous thrombosis. Catheter outcome data were compared to determine if statistically significant differences existed between the suture and StatLock groups. The results showed that the StatLock group had a significantly lower incidence of catheter-related complications compared to the suture group.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, attachment of synovial fibroblasts (SFs) to laminin-111 did not activate the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), but addition of transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) induced a fivefold higher expression of MMP-3. Incubation of SF on LM-111 in the presence of TGFbeta induced a significant 12-fold higher expression of MMP-3 mRNA, and secretion of MMP-3 was elevated 20-fold above controls. Functional blocking of LM-111-integrin interaction reduced the laminin-activated MMP-3 expression significantly. Stimulation of SF by LM-111 and TGFbeta activated the p38MAPK, ERK and SMAD2 pathways, and inhibition of these pathways by using SB203580, PD98059 or A-83-01 confirmed the involvement of these pathways in the regulation of MMP-3.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, functional health literacy is associated with health status and health-related knowledge in people living with HIV-AIDS. HIV-infected people with lower health literacy had lower CD4 cell counts, higher viral loads, were less likely to be taking antiretroviral medications, reported a greater number of hospitalizations, and reported poorer health than those with higher health literacy. In addition, after adjusting for years of formal education, lower health literacy was associated with poorer knowledge of one's HIV-related health status, poorer AIDS-related disease and treatment knowledge, and more negative health care perceptions and experiences.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, trans-aortic Alfieri stitch is placed in the mitral valve through the aortotomy while performing septal myectomy for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study found that computer-assisted instruction (CAI) tutorial program improved clinical reasoning skills of undergraduate dietetics students. However, the improvement was not statistically significant in all areas. The study also found that Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCE) significantly improved students' mean readiness to practice their role as clinical dietitians. Additionally, the study found that collaboration with other healthcare professionals helped prepare students for the dietetic role.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, soy protein isolates of varied isoflavone content can influence serum thyroid hormones in healthy young men. The study found that consumption of high-isoflavone soy protein isolate (61.7 +/- 7.4 mg iso/day) led to a significant increase in serum total triiodothyronine (T3), free T3, total thyroxine (T4), free T4, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and thyroid binding globulin (TBG) compared to low-isoflavone soy protein isolate (1.64 +/- 0.19 mg iso/day) and milk protein isolate (MPI). However, there was no significant difference in serum thyroid hormone levels between the low-isoflavone soy protein isolate and MPI groups.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, immunity to blood stages of Plasmodium falciparum is dependent on a specific pattern of immunoglobulin subclass responses to multiple blood stage antigens. This is supported by previous studies showing that IgG1 and IgG3 responses against antigens like ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigens, merozoite surface proteins and variant surface antigens on schizonts were associated with clinical immunity against malaria. None of the specific responses against a single antigen was completely protective.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, recombination pattern reanalysis of some HIV-1 circulating recombination forms (CRFs) suggests the necessity and difficulty of revision. The current study was based on multiple recombination analysis, which may have produced more impartial results than previous studies that were based on a single recombination detection program. The analysis revealed that recombination events between different lineages and recombination events between putative reservoir virus and those from a later population were significantly stronger for the inferred ancestors of the X4 strains. Additionally, a significantly higher number of recombinants were predicted at sampling points that corresponded to peaks in the viral load levels. These findings suggest that recombination pattern reanalysis of some HIV-1 CRFs may be necessary and difficult to revise.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The current study investigates the role of osteopontin (OPN) in brain damage and repair after neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury. The authors identified OPN as the most highly upregulated factor early after HI and explored its role in brain damage and repair. The study found that OPN enhances endogenous repair after neonatal HI brain injury. The authors suggest that OPN may be a potential therapeutic target for neonatal HI brain injury.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, xenon pretreatment attenuates anesthetic-induced apoptosis in the developing brain in comparison with nitrous oxide and hypoxia.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, p130 plays a role in TGF-beta-induced cell-cycle arrest in Rb mutant HT-3 cells. TGF-beta inhibited the proliferation of HT-3 cells expressing mutant Rb protein and efficiently induced cell-cycle arrest at G(1) phase. p21 protein level was elevated in TGF-beta-treated HT-3 cells, while other G(1) regulatory protein levels were unaltered. TGF-beta markedly enhanced the binding of p21 with cdk2 but decreased that of cdk2 with cyclin E and inhibited the phosphorylation of p130 but did not change Rb and p107 protein status. We also found that E2F-1 protein level was lower in TGF-beta-treated cells and suggest that this might be the result of enhanced binding between E2F-4 and p130.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, past cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3, obesity, and earlier menopause are associated with an increased risk of vulval cancer in postmenopausal women.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, severity of coronary artery disease is not correlated to cerebrovascular reactivity. However, degree of coronary stenosis is correlated to cerebrovascular reactivity.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, family experiences and pediatric health services use are associated with family-centered rounds. A prospective study comparing families with a child admitted to general pediatric inpatient services with and without FCR found that the presence of FCR elements was associated with better family outcomes and health service use outcomes. The study used Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems measures to assess family outcomes and hour of discharge, number of medications, and overall charges to assess health service use outcomes. The study also used propensity score matching to account for differences on observed variables.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, high doses of EDU were not toxic to willow and did not act as nitrogen fertilizer. However, EDU increased the leaf N content.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, high maternal body mass index increases the risk of neonatal early onset group B streptococcal disease. In obese parturients with BMI > 30, there was an 80% increased risk for verified neonatal EOGBS disease (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.0). When cases with clinical sepsis were included a significant risk increment was also found in overweight women with BMI 25.0-29.9 (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.0).",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) decreases acute pneumonitis after irradiation in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro studies showed that CAPE cause no significant cytotoxicity in normal lung as compared to lung cancer cells. The results from in vivo study showed that CAPE treatment decreased the expression of inflammatory cytokines including IL-1 alpha and beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha and TGF- beta, after irradiation. Moreover, histological and immunochemical data revealed that CAPE decreased radiation- induced interstitial pneumonitis and TGF-beta expression.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, thymoglobulin administered early after heart transplantation reduces early myocardial hypertrophy assessed by morphometric studies. The study by [Document(page_content='The aim of this study was to assess the effects of early thymoglobulin administration on cardiocyte nuclear status in orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) recipients.')] found that thymoglobulin administration reduced myocardial hypertrophy in OHT recipients. The study by [Document(page_content='We investigated endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs) from 31 OHT recipients and 10 control cases. OHT patients were divided into the standard group who were treated without thymoglobulin; an ATG group who received thymoglobulin electively, and a standard+ATG group who were administered thymoglobulin upon a drop in renal function. We evaluated only EMBs obtained at 1 and 4 weeks after OHT showing no significant rejection (ISHLT grades 0 to 1B). The morphometric studies were performed using a computerized, automated Quantimet image analysis system. Overall, 1750 cardiocyte nuclei were quantitated for area, length, breadth, perimeter, chromatin median grey level, and",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, dNA-PKcs expression was found to be closely associated with biochemical recurrence in patients treated by permanent iodine 125 interstitial brachytherapy for prostate cancer. On multivariate analysis, dNA-PKcs expression remained predictive of recurrence, along with the Gleason score and prostate-specific antigen level.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, chemotherapy for cancer can cause apoptosis that precedes hypoplasia in crypts of the small intestine in humans.\n\nExplanation: The document context provides information about the effects of chemotherapy on apoptosis in different types of cancer. One document describes the effects of chemotherapy on the small intestine, stating that apoptosis increased sevenfold in intestinal crypts at one day, and villus area, crypt length, mitotic count per crypt, and enterocyte height decreased at three days after chemotherapy. This indicates that chemotherapy can cause apoptosis in the small intestine, which can lead to hypoplasia in crypts.\n\nThe background context also provides information about the mechanisms of gastrointestinal damage induced by cancer chemotherapy. One document describes the time course and mechanism of small intestinal damage following chemotherapy in humans, stating that apoptosis is a stereotypical pathway of cell death that is orchestrated by a family of cysteine endoproteases called caspases. This indicates that chemotherapy can cause apoptosis in the small intestine, which can lead to hypoplasia in crypts.\n\nOverall, the information provided in the document context and background context supports the conclusion that chemotherapy for cancer can cause apoptosis that precedes hypoplasia in crypt",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, alveolar macrophage gene expression is altered in the setting of alcohol use disorders. A recent study determined that chronic alcohol consumption causes persistent oxidative stress in the lung, leading to impaired alveolar macrophage (AM) function and impaired immune responses. The study also found that alcohol-induced oxidative stress increases the expression of transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF\u03b21) in the lung, which may contribute to the development of pulmonary diseases associated with AUDs. Additionally, a whole genome microarray analysis was performed on alveolar macrophages obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage from a test cohort of subjects with AUDs, and controls who were pair-matched on age, gender, and smoking. Probe set expression differences in this cohort were validated by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT RT-PCR). Functional analysis with web-based bioinformatics tools was utilized with microarray data to assess differentially expressed candidate genes (p < 0.01) based on alcohol consumption. Alveolar macrophage mRNA samples from a second cohort of subjects with AUDs were used to confirm gene expression differences related to AUDs.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, a diminished postnatal surge of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants is additional evidence for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The study found that the number of Ad spermatogonia increased markedly after five months of life in the control population, but it was distinctly lower in the cryptorchid testes. This surge was completely absent in the cryptorchid testes. The number of Ad spermatogonia in unilateral cryptorchid testes correlated in a nonlinear fashion with those in the contralateral scrotal testes. The total number of germ cells in the cryptorchid testes in the first six months of life is normal, after which time it declines rapidly. This suggests that the development of Ad spermatogonia is impaired in cryptorchid infants, which is consistent with the diagnosis of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, female children were nearly three times more likely to be stunted than male children. Households that were food insecure with hunger were also three times more likely than other households to have a stunted child.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, combination therapy with VELCADE and tissue plasminogen activator is neuroprotective in aged rats after stroke and targets microRNA-146a and the toll-like receptor signaling pathway. The present study tested the hypothesis that combination treatment with VELCADE and tissue plasminogen activator modulates the TLR signaling pathway on cerebral vasculature, which leads to neuroprotection in aged rats after stroke. The study found that combination treatment with VELCADE and tissue plasminogen activator reduced infarct volume compared with respective monotherapies. The study also found that the combination treatment increased miR-l46a levels, which was inversely associated with the reduction of vascular interleukin-1 receptor-activated kinases 1 immunoreactivity. In vitro, fibrin upregulated interleukin-1 receptor-activated kinases 1 and TLR4 expression and downregulated miR-146a on primary human cerebral endothelial cells. VELCADE elevated miR-146 levels and abolished fibrin-increased interleukin-1 receptor activated kinases 1 proteins. The study also found that microglia activation after stroke is characterized by marked and long-term",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, peak weight velocity in infancy is not negatively associated with lung function in adolescence. In fact, a study found that higher peak weight velocity during the first two years of life was associated with better spirometric lung function indices at 15 years of age. However, it is important to note that this association may be influenced by other factors such as birth weight and body mass index.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, garlic-derived S-allylmercaptocysteine has been shown to have hepato-protective effects in an animal model of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Recent in vitro studies have shown that S-allylmercaptocysteine suppresses invasion and cell motility of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells via the up-regulation of cell-adhesion molecule E-cadherin. S-allylmercaptocysteine is therefore a potential antimetastatic drug with broad clinical applications that has been tested in vivo for the first time in this study.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, chest compression fraction determines survival in patients with out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation. The study found that the odds ratios of surviving to hospital discharge in the 2 highest categories of chest compression fraction compared with the reference category were 3.01 (95% confidence interval 1.37 to 6.58) and 2.33 (95% confidence interval 0.96 to 5.63).",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, expression of snail in pancreatic cancer promotes metastasis and chemoresistance. In a study, snail expression was found in 36% of pancreatic cancer samples and was closely correlated with lymph node invasion and distant metastasis. After transfecting snail cDNA into pancreatic cancer cell line Panc-1, the cells underwent overt epithelial to mesenchymal transitions, which promoted the invasive ability in vitro and increased the ability to produce spontaneous metastasis in vivo. Overexpression of snail also enhanced the chemoresistance to 5-fluorouracil of gemcitabine at different dosages.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, knockdown of SLUG significantly inhibited lung cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Furthermore, knockdown of SLUG induced the down-regulation of Bcl-2 and up-regulation of E-cadherin.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study included 36 women with moderately advanced local breast cancer larger than 2 cm in diameter. Twelve were allocated to receive a standard regimen of 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (FEC) preoperatively as controls, and 24 were given the most suitable regimen according to testing; the options were FEC, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF), 5-fluorouracil, adriamycin and mitomycin C (FAM) and paclitaxel alone. The cell activities of drug-treated solid tumors were compared to controls with a highly sensitive ATP bioluminescence assay. Patients received chemotherapy according to sensitivity results and the tumor area clinically measured before and after chemotherapy. The study aimed to better understand human breast cancer biology by studying how the timing of metastasis following primary resection is affected by adjuvant CMF (cyclophoshamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil) chemotherapy. The study did not specifically evaluate the role of postoperative CMF in ameliorating poor outcomes in women with residual invasive breast cancer after neoadjuvant epirubicin/docetaxel chemotherapy",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the WD40 domain is required for LRRK2 neurotoxicity. Removing the WD40 domain prevents complex formation and autophosphorylation, and completely blocks the neurotoxicity of multiple LRRK2 PD mutations.",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, prenatal lipopolysaccharide exposure during the final 2 weeks of pregnancy induced schizophrenia-like behavioral symptoms, such as deficits in sensorimotor gating (prepulse inhibition) and impairments in social interactions and exploration, in adult offspring. Moreover, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that in our neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia, decreases in the total number of PV- and GAD67-positive neurons in the medial prefrontal cortices of adult females prenatally exposed to LPS were observed, whereas these immunochemical changes were primarily detected in the hippocampus of males. Additionally, a decrease in PV-labeled axon terminals of GABA-ergic cells, likely reflecting the perisomatic inhibitory innervation of pyramidal neurons, was observed in the medial prefrontal cortices in both sexes.\n\nCompared to the control group, the LPS-treated dams presented reduced maternal behavior, decreased general activity, a smaller body weight difference between GD21 and PND1, a greater number of perinatal deaths, and smaller litters. For the male pups, LPS treatment resulted in a decreased body weight on PND2, whereas the anogenital",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (AFABP) levels have been found to be significantly elevated in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and correlate with indices of adiposity, inflammation, and fibrosis. AFABP has been identified as a key mediator of inflammatory response in macrophages and plays a role in both lipopolysaccaride (LPS)-induced acute liver injury and high fat high cholesterol (HFHC) diet-induced NAFLD in mice.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, timing variability during gait initiation was increased in people with Alzheimer's disease compared to controls. The study found that people with mild-moderate AD had greater variability of gait at initiation in stride timing (AD CV = 4.65, Control CV = 3.64; p < 0.05, d = 0.71) and double support proportion (AD CV = 9.40, Control CV = 7.62; p < 0.05, d = 0.8) compared to controls.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, pitching biomechanics as a pitcher approaches muscular fatigue during a simulated baseball game. Compared with the initial 2 innings, as a pitcher approached muscular fatigue during the final 2 innings he was able to pitch, there was a significant decrease in ball velocity, and the trunk was significantly closer to a vertical position. There were no other significant differences in kinematics or kinetics variables.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the bisphosphonate Pamidronate has been shown to improve chemically induced trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid and dextran sulfate sodium colitis in rats and lymphocyte transfer colitis in mice. Pamidronate has no effect on intestinal epithelial cells in vitro in terms of cytokine/chemokine release, but enhances IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, and IL-10 production by T cells in coculture. Pamidronate also exerts a direct immunomodulatory effect on T cells, favoring Th1 differentiation and impairing Th17 polarization.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, experience with bilateral cochlear implants improves sound localization acuity in children. A study conducted on children who underwent sequential bilateral cochlear implantation showed that they had a smaller minimum audible angle (MAA) compared to children who underwent unilateral cochlear implantation. The MAA is a measure of the smallest angle from midline that can be reliably discriminated, and a smaller MAA indicates better sound localization acuity. The study also found that children with bilateral cochlear implants performed better in sound localization tasks compared to children with unilateral cochlear implants. This suggests that experience with bilateral cochlear implants improves sound localization acuity in children.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, there is no evidence to suggest that GM-CSF contributes to prompt healing of ecthyma gangrenosum lesions in kidney transplant recipients. The study evaluating the potential effects of GM-CSF on the incidence of rejection and allograft vasculopathy in heart transplant recipients did not find any significant difference in the healing of ecthyma gangrenosum lesions between the GM-CSF-treated and control groups.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the study found a strong logarithmic correlation between a decrease in the corneal endothelial cell density and the percentage of pterygium to cornea in patients with unilateral primary pterygium.\n\nExplanation: The study enrolled 90 consecutive patients with unilateral primary pterygium and measured the corneal endothelial cell density in both eyes. The results showed a strong logarithmic correlation between a decrease in the corneal endothelial cell density and the percentage of pterygium to cornea. This suggests that pterygium is related to a decrease in corneal endothelial cell density.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, long-term reversal of hypocholesterolaemia in patients with chronic hepatitis C is related to sustained viral response and viral genotype. In patients with genotype-3 of HCV and sustained viral response, serum cholesterol increased from 138 (95% CI: 120-151) to 180 mg/dL (95% CI: 171-199) 12 months after treatment conclusion (P < 0.0001). By contrast, cholesterol values were unchanged in genotype-3 of HCV non-responders and in patients with genotype-1 of HCV regardless of response. Rising cholesterol in sustained viral response did not parallel the changes in beta-hydroxybutyrate.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, life style interventions/weight reduction in moderately overweight individuals did not decrease levels of cathepsins L and S in plasma.\n\nExplanation: The study aimed to investigate the association between life style interventions/weight reduction and decreased levels of cathepsins L and S in plasma. However, the study did not find any association between life style interventions/weight reduction and decreased levels of cathepsins L and S in plasma. The study also found that higher cathepsin S was associated with higher CRP and IL-6, but this association remained similar in normal-weight participants. Therefore, it is unlikely that life style interventions/weight reduction would have a significant effect on decreasing levels of cathepsins L and S in plasma.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, a novel polymorphism of the CYP19 gene was not found to be associated with essential hypertension in China.\n\nExplanation: The question is asking about a novel polymorphism of the CYP19 gene and its association with essential hypertension in China. However, the provided context does not mention any novel polymorphism of the CYP19 gene. The context only mentions the association of the CYP19 gene polymorphisms with essential hypertension in China. Therefore, the answer is no, a novel polymorphism of the CYP19 gene was not found to be associated with essential hypertension in China.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, simple and complex alternative splicing (ASE) patterns may be subject to opposite selection pressure for protein reading frame preservation. Simple ASEs have higher frequency of reading frame preservation (FRFP) than constitutively spliced exons (CSEs), while complex ASEs have lower FRFP than CSEs. Conservation of the ASE/CSE splicing pattern increases the FRFPs of simple ASEs but decreases those of complex ASEs. Contrary to the well-recognized concept of strong selection pressure on conserved ASEs for protein reading frame preservation, our results show that conserved complex ASEs are relaxed from such pressure and the frame-disrupting effect caused by the insertion of complex ASEs can be offset by compensatory changes in their flanking exons.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, high nuclear expression of HDGF correlates with disease progression and poor prognosis in human endometrial carcinoma. A study of 122 endometrial carcinoma patients found that higher HDGF expression was significantly associated with lymphatic metastasis and poorer 5-year overall survival rate. Additionally, HDGF expression was found to exist in all ovarian cancer cell lines with different expression levels.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study suggests that whole-body scanning with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is useful in assessing the value of FDG-PET in a large cohort of Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) patients from a single center. However, the study does not directly compare the usefulness of FDG-PET in the initial assessment versus follow-up of ECD patients. Therefore, it is not clear whether FDG-PET scanning is more useful in follow-up than in the initial assessment of patients with ECD. Further research is needed to determine the optimal use of FDG-PET in the initial assessment and follow-up of ECD patients.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) was significantly higher in tumor tissues than that in the adjacent normal tissues in human head and neck, skin, pancreatic, and prostate tumor samples examined.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, matrix metalloproteinase-9 deletion reverses auditory evoked potential habituation deficit in a mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, air quality can influence the prevalence of hay fever and sinusitis. The National Health Interview Survey for the calendar years 1997-2006 adult sample was analyzed to determine for each calendar year the one-year period prevalence of the two respiratory conditions, hay fever and sinusitis and the nonrespiratory (control) condition, weak/failing kidneys. From the Environmental Protection Agency, yearly historical data for air quality criteria pollutants, carbon monoxide, nitrous dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter, were tabulated. Graphical and linear regression analyses were conducted for each disease condition against each of the air quality variables to determine if higher pollutant concentrations predicted a higher prevalence for the disease condition.\n\nFurthermore, nasal irritation and associated symptoms (nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and sinus headache) are important elements of the response to indoor and outdoor air pollution. Marked interindividual variability in such symptoms has been suggested clinically and epidemiologically, but little experimental data exist on this issue.\n\nIn the study conducted on fifty patients with hay fever, all of them had moderate-severe grade of nasal obstruction. Total symptom score (TSS), rhinomanometry, nasal lavage, nasal scrap",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, S 23521 decreased food intake and body weight gain in diet-induced obese rats.\n\nExplanation: The study showed that S 23521, a new glucagon-like peptide-1-(7-36) amide analogue, decreased food intake and body weight gain in diet-induced obese rats. The subcutaneous treatment at high dose was selected to test the effect on selected end-points, and treated obese rats significantly decreased their cumulative energy intake in relation to vehicle-treated counterparts, reduced their body weight gain, and improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. No changes in uncoupling protein-1, uncoupling protein-3, leptin, resistin, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma were observed.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the age of first exposure to Toxoplasma gondii can affect the development of anti-NMDA receptor autoantibodies and associated neurobehavioral pathology in mice. Juvenile-infected mice exhibited decreased pre-pulse inhibition of the acoustic startle (PPI) in response to MK-801, while adult-infected mice exhibited increased PPI in response to MK-801. Additionally, juvenile-infected mice had significantly greater elevations of GLUN2 autoantibodies compared to adult-infected mice. Age-dependent differences were also found in regional expression of NMDAR subunits and markers of glutamatergic, GABAergic, and monoaminergic systems. Activated microglia and C1q elevations were found in both juvenile- and adult-T. gondii infected mice. These findings suggest that the age of first exposure to Toxoplasma gondii can affect the development of anti-NMDA receptor autoantibodies and associated neurobehavioral pathology in mice.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, risedronate gastrointestinal absorption is not independent of site and rate of administration. In study A, no statistically significant site-specific differences in any pharmacokinetic parameter were observed, and in study B, the extent of risedronate absorption did not differ significantly following a rapid or a slow infusion.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the study suggests that neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) protects renal tubular epithelial cells in hypoxia-reperfusion by reducing apoptosis.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, high body mass index (BMI) was associated with increased diurnal strains in the articular cartilage of the knee. Subjects with high BMI had significantly thicker cartilage on both the patella and femoral groove, as compared to subjects with normal BMI. Diurnal cartilage strains were dependent on location in the knee joint, as well as BMI. Subjects with high BMI, compared to those with normal BMI, exhibited significantly higher compressive strains in the tibial cartilage. Cartilage thickness on both femoral condyles decreased significantly from the AM to the PM time point; however, there was no significant effect of BMI on diurnal cartilage strain in the femur.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, corticosterone is involved in electroacupuncture-produced anti-edema in a rat model of inflammation. Electroacupuncture (EA) significantly increased plasma corticosterone levels 2 hours and 5 hours after complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) administration compared to sham EA control, but EA alone in naive rats and CFA alone did not induce significant increases in corticosterone. Adrenalectomy blocked EA-produced anti-edema, but not EA anti-hyperalgesia. RU486, a prototypical glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, also prevented EA anti-edema.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the study suggests that soluble oncoprotein 185HER-2 in pleural fluid has limited usefulness for the diagnostic evaluation of malignant effusions. The sensitivity of pleural sp185(HER-2) levels for malignant effusions was only 7% and nonsignificantly increased by adding it to a panel of tumor markers. Additionally, the diagnostic accuracy of pleural sp185(HER-2) levels for malignancy was only 71.5%. Therefore, it appears that other tumor markers, such as CEA and CA 15-3, may be more useful for the diagnosis of malignant effusions.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, bevacizumab and Temozolomide do not have a significant difference in causing mitochondrial dysfunction in human brain tumors. The study determined the direct effects of both drugs on mitochondria isolated from human brain tumors and found that they both caused mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the study did not compare the effects of bevacizumab and Temozolomide on mitochondrial dysfunction in human brain tumors.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study found that plasma vasopressin expressed a diurnal rhythm with a night-time increase in both genders, but there was no difference in urine osmolality or aquaporin-2 excretion between genders. The study also found a trend towards a higher reabsorption of free water in males, but no significant difference in diuresis or urine output between genders. Therefore, it is not clear if urinary concentration exclusively relies on plasma vasopressin, and further research is needed to determine the role of other factors in urine regulation.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, plasma levels of angiostatin and endostatin are significantly increased for 2-4 weeks after colorectal cancer surgery.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, adherence to the 2006 American Heart Association Diet and Lifestyle Recommendations (AHA-DLR) is associated with bone health in older Puerto Ricans. In a cross-sectional study of 933 Puerto Ricans aged 47-79 y, the American Heart Association Diet and Lifestyle Score (AHA-DLS) was modified to test associations with bone health. Bone mineral density (BMD) at the femoral neck, trochanter, total hip, and lumbar spine (L2-L4) was measured by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The results showed that higher AHA-DLS scores were associated with higher BMD at all bone sites. In another cross-sectional study of 629 Puerto Rican adults aged 47-79 y, bone mineral density (BMD) of the femoral neck, trochanter, total femur, and lumbar spine (L2-L4) were measured by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). AFM and total fat mass (TFM) were assessed by using body-composition software from whole-body DXA scans. Osteoporosis and osteopenia were defined as T-scores \u2264 -2.5 and -1.0",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, basophils are recruited to inflamed lungs and exacerbate memory Th2 responses in mice and humans.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe context provides several documents that discuss the role of basophils in allergic inflammation and Th2 responses. In one study, basophils were purified from the lungs of OVA-sensitized and OVA-challenged (OVA-immunized) mice or human peripheral blood for in vivo and in vitro functional studies. Pulmonary basophils were adoptively transferred to OVA-sensitized hosts to assess airway inflammation in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and Th2 responses in lung explants and draining LNs. Basophils were co-cultured with effector T cells or Ag-specific na\u00efve T cells alone or in combination with dendritic cells (DCs); IL-4 production was determined by flow cytometry and ELISA. The study found that basophils exacerbated memory Th2 responses in mice and humans.\n\nAnother study found that basophils accumulated in the lungs of OVA-immunized mice and that adoptive transfer of basophils to OVA-sensitized hosts enhanced lung IL-4 and IL-13 release",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, inhibition of Toll-like receptor 4 with eritoran attenuates myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.\n\nExplanation: The study evaluated the effect of eritoran, a specific TLR4 antagonist, on MI/R injury in C3H/HeJ mice subjected to myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MI/R) injury. The results showed that eritoran attenuated myocardial infarction size, indicating that inhibition of TLR4 with eritoran may be a potential therapeutic option for MI/R injury.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate supplementation does not affect Walker 256 tumor-bearing rats in a time-dependent manner.\n\nExplanation: The provided documents do not mention any study or experiment that investigates the effects of beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate supplementation on Walker 256 tumor-bearing rats in a time-dependent manner. The only document that mentions Walker 256 tumor is the first one, which describes the transplantation of Walker 256 carcinosarcoma cells into rat livers and the use of hepatic arterial ligation to block the hepatic arterial blood supply. However, this document does not mention any supplementation with beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate. Therefore, it is not possible to answer the question based on the provided context.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, nT-ProBNP predicts rhythm stability after cardioversion of lone atrial fibrillation. The study found that NT-proBNP serum levels were significantly higher in patients who experienced a relapse of AF after cardioversion compared to patients who maintained sinus rhythm. Additionally, NT-proBNP was an independent predictor of AF recurrence, whereas NT-proANP was not. Furthermore, NT-proBNP had an incremental value over echocardiographic characteristics to predict AF recurrence after RFCA.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, dietary creatine supplementation does not affect some haematological indices, or indices of muscle damage and hepatic and renal function.\n\nExplanation: The provided context includes several documents that discuss the effects of creatine supplementation on various indices. However, none of these documents report any detrimental effects of creatine supplementation on haematological indices, or indices of muscle damage and hepatic and renal function. In fact, some studies even report no differences in these indices between creatine-supplemented and control-diet fed animals. Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be concluded that dietary creatine supplementation does not affect these indices.",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, chronic administration of atypical antipsychotics, such as risperidone and clozapine, improves behavioral and synaptic defects of STOP null mice. Long-term administration of either drug results in alleviation of behavioral alterations mimicking some negative symptoms and partial amelioration of some cognitive defects in STOP null mice. Additionally, clozapine treatment also improves synaptic plasticity of the STOP null animals by restoring long-term potentiation in the hippocampus.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, Chlamydia pneumoniae has been associated with atherosclerotic disease and has been identified in atherosclerotic plaques. However, it is unclear whether infection has a genuinely etiologic role in this disease, whether its presence influences clinical outcomes, and, if so, at which stages of disease this occurs. The present study was designed to clarify whether this association is based on C pneumoniae-induced transformation of a stable into an unstable atherosclerotic plaque or on stimulation of hypercoagulability leading to increased thrombotic arterial occlusions by C pneumoniae infection. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonographic monitoring of the middle cerebral artery during carotid endarterectomy offers the opportunity to study, before removal of the plaque, atherothrombotic emboli dislodging from an unstable carotid plaque (plaque-related emboli) and emboli related to (excessive) thrombus formation at the endarterectomy site after removal of the plaque and restoration of flow (thrombosis-related emboli). The study found that elevated titers of antibodies and circulating immune complexes to C pneumoniae were associated with ultrasound findings indicating presence of ather",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, moxibustion activates mast cell degranulation at the ST25 in rats with colitis. The study found that rats in the moxibustion group had a markedly higher degranulation ratio of mast cells at ST25 acupoint areas compared to the model group (45.91 \u00b1 11.41 vs 32.58 \u00b1 8.28, P < 0.05).",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, optic nerve blood flow is diminished in eyes of primary open-angle glaucoma suspects. This is evident from the study that used laser Doppler flowmetry to measure optic nerve head blood velocity, volume, and flow at four quadrants in the optic nerve, in the cup, and in the foveola of one eye of each patient. The mean flow from the superotemporal rim, inferotemporal rim, and cup was calculated (Flow(3)) and identified as the main outcome measure. Measurements from primary open-angle glaucoma suspect eyes were compared with corresponding measurements from controls and eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma; a Student t test was employed with a Bonferroni corrected P value of.025 to show that there was a significant decrease in optic nerve blood flow in primary open-angle glaucoma suspect eyes compared to controls and eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma."

      "Slug down-regulation promotes cell apoptosis and decreases invasion capability in vitro and in vivo. Slug inhibition may represent a novel strategy for treatment of metastatic ESCC.",
      "In this population, which included a high percentage of patients with luminal cancers, pCR did not predict for improved OS. Postneoadjuvant chemotherapy showed no discernible benefit even in subgroups with aggressive tumor biology or significant remaining tumor burden. The use of such treatment should therefore be discouraged outside of clinical trials.",
      "These findings suggest that LRRK2 dimerization and autophosphorylation may be required for the neurotoxicity of LRRK2 PD mutations and highlight a potential role for the WD40 domain in the mechanism of LRRK2-mediated cell death.",
      "Inhibition of leukocyte function with MoAb 60.3 does not afford protection from severe focal ischemia and reperfusion in cats.",
      "We propose that prenatal LPS exposure on GD21 acts as an imprinting factor that interferes with the programming of brain sexual determination in offspring.",
      "Circulating AFABP, produced by adipocytes and macrophages, and lipocalin-2, produced by multiple tissues, are elevated and may contribute to the metabolic syndrome in NAFLD. AFABP levels, which correlate with subcutaneous, but not visceral fat, independently predict inflammation and fibrosis in NAFLD and may have a direct pathogenic link to disease progression.",

      "The T allele of rs2289105 in CYP19 gene might be a protective genetic marker of EH for women in Han population.",
      "In this study, we find that simple and complex ASEs undergo opposite selection pressure for protein reading frame preservation, with CSEs in-between. Simple ASEs have much higher FRFPs than complex ones. We further find that the FRFPs of complex ASEs coupled with flanking exons are close to those of simple ASEs, indicating that neighboring exons of an ASE may evolve in a coordinated way to avoid protein dysfunction. Therefore, we suggest that evolutionary analyses of AS should take into consideration the effects of different splicing patterns and the joint effects of multiple AS events.",
      "Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that HDGF was expressed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. High nuclear expression of HDGF was positively correlated with FIGO stage (P = 0.032), but not associated with other clinical features, such as histological grading or lymph node status. Patients with high expression of HDGF had poorer overall survival rates than those with low expression of HDGF (P = 0.001). However, multivariate analyses showed that high nuclear expression of HDGF protein was not an independent predictor of prognosis for EC patients (P = 0.111). Our results suggest that high nuclear expression of HDGF is a potential unfavorable factor for the progression and prognosis of EC.",
      "The results of our large, single-center, retrospective study suggest that the findings of a FDG-PET scan may be interesting in the initial assessment of patients with ECD, but its greater contribution is in followup of these patients.",
      "Over expression of UCP2 in certain tumors provides the rationale to speculate that UCP2 may promote tumor growth in these cancers.",
      "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading known genetic cause of autism spectrum disorders. Individuals with FXS show symptoms of auditory hypersensitivity. These symptoms may arise due to sustained neural responses to repeated sounds, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. For the first time, this study shows deficits in habituation of neural responses to repeated sounds in the Fmr1 KO mice as seen in humans with FXS. We also report an abnormally high level of matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) in the auditory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice and that deletion of Mmp-9 from Fmr1 KO mice reverses habituation deficits. These data provide a translation relevant electrophysiological biomarker for sensory deficits in FXS and implicate MMP-9 as a target for drug discovery.",

      "S 23521 is an effective glucagon-like peptide-1-(7-36) amide analogue, which induced a decrease in energy intake, body weight, and adiposity in a rat model of diet-induced obesity. In addition, the treatment also improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity of obese rats. These results strongly support S 23521 as a putative molecule for the treatment of obesity.",
      "Our study demonstrates that the age at first exposure to T. gondii is an important factor in shaping distinct behavioral and neurobiological abnormalities. Elevation in GLUN2 autoantibodies or complement protein C1q may be a potential underlying mechanism. A better understanding of these age-related differences may lead to more efficient treatments of behavioral disorders associated with T. gondii infection.",
      "These studies indicate that the rate and extent of risedronate absorption are independent of the site of administration along the gastrointestinal tract, and that the extent of absorption is not affected by the rate of administration.",
      "These findings indicate that NGAL reduces apoptosis by regulating the four apoptosis factors Bcl-2, Bax, Fas and FasL through its two receptors 24p3R and megalin. These results also suggest that ectopic expression of NGAL in renal cells might provide a therapeutic strategy in ischemia-reperfusion by reducing apoptosis and promoting renal cell proliferation.",
      "Increased BMI is associated with increased diurnal strains in articular cartilage of both the medial and lateral compartments of the knee. The increased cartilage strains observed in individuals with high BMI may, in part, explain the elevated risk of OA associated with obesity or may reflect alterations in the cartilage mechanical properties in subjects with high BMI.",

      "Similar urinary flows and osmolalities are associated with levels of plasma vasopressin and renal PGE2, which are higher in males than in females. Oxytocin does not seem to play a role in the diurnal urine formation, whereas prostaglandin E2 could represent a mediator of the gender difference, not only as a mediator of the vasopressin response, but also as an independent factor. These findings need further elucidation.",
      "MICR has a very transient impact on plasma levels of endostatin and no impact on angiostatin during the first 21 days following surgery. Thus, angiostatin and endostatin do not likely contribute to or inhibit the persistent proangiogenic changes noted after MICR.",

      "The probability of a successful cardioversion correlates inversely with NT-proBNP values. The short-term success of a cardioversion might be predicted by prior determination of NT-proBNP.",
      "These data provide evidence that there are no obvious adverse effects of acute or more chronic Cr supplementation on the haematological indices measured, nor on hepatic, muscle, and renal function. Therefore there is no apparent health risk associated with Cr supplementation to healthy people when it is ingested in quantities that have been scientifically proven to increase muscle Cr stores.",
      "Our data provide strong evidence that both cAMP effectors, Epac and PKA, and the levels of intracellular calcium are involved in the hepatic cystogenesis of ARPKD.",
      "All together, the pharmacological reactivity of STOP null mice to antipsychotics evokes the pharmacological response of humans to such drugs. Totally, our study suggests that STOP null mice may provide a useful preclinical model to evaluate pharmacological properties of antipsychotic drugs.",
      "This study confirms that C pneumoniae is a common finding in atherosclerotic plaques of the carotid artery but suggests that the presence of the infectious organism has little detectable impact on plaque instability when measured by clinically significant markers. This raises important questions for the rationale of antibiotic therapy in atherosclerosis.",

      "Laser Doppler flowmetry detected circulatory abnormalities in primary open-angle glaucoma suspects who did not have any manifest visual field defect. Decreases in flow in glaucoma suspects were similar in magnitude to those of subjects with primary open-angle glaucoma. These data suggest that impaired optic nerve blood flow develops early in the glaucomatous process and does not develop solely as a result of glaucoma damage."
