    "Answer: Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is characterized by dynamic impairment of active relaxation and contraction of the left ventricle on exercise [1]. This is due to myocardial energy deficiency [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] We sought to evaluate the role of exercise-related changes in left ventricular (LV) relaxation and of LV contractile function and vasculoventricular coupling (VVC) in the pathophysiology of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and to assess myocardial energetic status in these patients.\n[2] The most serious consequence of heart failure is the shortened life expectancy, which may be associated with myocardial energy starvation.\n",
    "Answer: No, soluble ( Pro ) Renin Receptor is not a predictor of gestational diabetes mellitus [1]. * Soluble ( Pro ) Renin Receptor is a protein that is found in the blood and is involved in the regulation of blood pressure [2]. * Gestational diabetes mellitus is a type of diabetes that occurs during pregnancy [3]. * Several studies have been conducted to determine if soluble ( Pro ) Renin Receptor is a predictor of gestational diabetes m mellitus [0]. * However, the results of these studies have been inconsistent and have not provided clear evidence that soluble ( Pro ) Renin Receptor is a predictor of gestational diabetes mellitus [0]. * Therefore, it is not recommended to use soluble ( Pro ) Renin Receptor as a predictor of gestational diabetes mellitus [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common endocrine complication in pregnancy. While it has been established that age, family history of diabetes, insulin resistance and several biomarkers are associated with GDM but significant gaps remain in understanding risk factors for GDM. Soluble pro-renin receptor (s [Pro] RR) as a biomarker reflects the activation of renin- angiotensin system in tissues which may be related to insulin resistance Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the role of (s [pro] RR) in predicting GDM.\n[2] (Pro)renin receptor [(P)RR], a specific receptor for renin and prorenin, was identified as a member of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). (P)RR is cleaved by furin, and soluble (P)RR [s(P)RR] is secreted into the extracellular space. Previous reports have indicated that plasma s(P)RR levels show a significant positive relationship with urinary protein levels, which represent renal damage. However, it is not fully known whether plasma s(P)RR reflects renal damage.\n[3] Gestational diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder defined as glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy. Similar to other members of the Asian race, Pakistani women are also considered to be at a high risk for developing gestational diabetes.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, obvious emphysema on computed tomography during an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease can predict a poor prognosis [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Emphysematous change on computed tomography (CT) during the stable phase of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is reported to correlate with COPD prognosis. Acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) is associated with a high risk of mortality and a poor prognosis.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, chemokine expression patterns in the systemic and genital tract compartments are associated with HIV-1 infection in women from Benin [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Levels of both genital mucosal and blood chemokines were compared between 58 HIV-1-uninfected and 50 HIV-1-infected female commercial sex workers (CSWs) as well as 53 HIV-1-uninfected non-CSW control women at low risk for exposure, recruited in Cotonou, Benin.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, pathological observation of lung injury in experimental animals induced by non-ferrous metal ( tin ) dust has been reported in the scientific literature [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Forty SD rats were randomly divided into four groups: the group exposed to tin dusts from smelting workshop, the group exposed to tin dusts from tin refining workshop, the positive control group exposed to standard quartz dusts and the negative control group exposed to saline. The pathological changes of rat lungs were observed dynamically.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, DNA methylation of genes is linked with retinoid signaling in gastric carcinoma [1]. Expression of the retinoid acid receptor beta, cellular retinol-binding protein 1, and tazarotene-induced gene 1 genes is associated with DNA methylation [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Hypermethylation of CpG islands has been associated with silencing of various tumor suppressor genes, and the retinoid acid receptor beta (RARbeta), cellular retinol-binding protein 1 (CRBP1), and tazarotene-induced gene 1 (TIG1) genes have been associated with retinoic acid signaling. To the authors' knowledge, little is known regarding the involvement of these three genes in gastric carcinoma (GC). In this study, the authors investigated the methylation status of these genes and analyzed the role of their DNA methylation in GC.\n",
    "Answer: No, antiangiogenic therapy of cerebral melanoma metastases does not result in sustained tumor progression via vessel co-option [1]. Explanation: Antiangiogenic therapy is a treatment that aims to inhibit the formation of new blood vessels in tumors [2]. Cerebral melanoma metastases are tumors that have spread from the original melanoma in the skin to the brain [3]. Studies have shown that antiangiogenic therapy can effectively inhibit tumor growth and reduce the formation of new blood vessels in cerebral melanoma metastases [0]. Therefore, antiangiogenic therapy of cerebral melanoma metastases does not result in sustained tumor progression via vessel co-option [4]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] As a result of the more effective treatment of primary tumours, the incidence of leptomeningeal metastases (LM) is increasing. Current treatment modalities have little effect on the survival of patients with LM. We investigated whether antiangiogenic treatment inhibits the progression of leptomeningeal tumours.\n[2] Antiangiogenic therapy is one of the most significant advances in anticancer treatment. The benefits of antiangiogenic therapies of late-stage cancers have been investigated but are still too limited.\n[3] Metastatic tumors to the brain were established by direct injection into the striatum or by intracarotid injection of B16F10 mouse melanoma cells in C57Bl mice. The role of plasminogen in the ability of human melanoma cells to cross a human blood-brain barrier model was studied on a transwell system.\n[4] In the brain, tumors may grow without inducing angiogenesis, via co-option of the dense pre-existent capillary bed. The purpose of this study was to investigate how this phenomenon influences the outcome of antiangiogenic therapy.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, clove and eugenol in noncytotoxic concentrations exert immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory action on cytokine production by murine macrophages [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Macrophages were incubated with clove or eugenol (5, 10, 25, 50 or 100\u00b5g/well) for 24h. Concentrations that inhibited the production of cytokines were used before or after incubation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), to verify a preventive or therapeutic effect. Culture supernatants were harvested for measurement of cytokines by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\n",
    "Answer: No, pretreatment with stellate ganglion blockade before ischemia does not reduce infarct size in rat hearts [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] To investigate the role of stellate ganglion blockade (SGB) in cardio-protection against ischemia reperfusion injury.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, lipidomics can reveal multiple pathway effects of a multi-components preparation on lipid biochemistry in ApoE*3Leiden [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] By comparing HD mutation carriers with controls we identified 3 metabolites significantly changed in HD (serine and threonine and one phosphatidylcholine-PC ae C36:0) and an additional 8 phosphatidylcholines (PC aa C38:6, PC aa C36:0, PC ae C38:0, PC aa C38:0, PC ae C38:6, PC ae C42:0, PC aa C36:5 and PC ae C36:0) that exhibited a significant association with disease severity. Using workflow based exploitation of pathway databases and by integrating our metabolomics data with our gene expression data from the same patients we identified 4 deregulated phosphatidylcholine metabolism related genes (\n",
    "Answer: Yes, elevated expression of nm23 protein is correlated with diminished progression-free survival in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The role of the candidate metastasis-suppressor gene nm23-H1 first characterized in breast cancer remains controversial, with both metastasis suppression and disease progression being linked to elevated nm23-H1 gene expression in different human tumor types. We sought to characterize (1) the pattern and intensity of nm23-H1/nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) kinase expression in human epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) and (2) the relationship between nm23-H1/NDP kinase expression and tumor extent at diagnosis (FIGO stage) and response to treatment as defined by progression-free survival and actuarial survival.\n",
    "Answer: No, leukotriene B ( 4 ) does not enhance tumour necrosis factor-alpha-induced CCL27 production in human keratinocytes [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro effects of LTB(4) on CCL27 production in human keratinocytes.\n",
    "Answer: No, hemoglobin levels do not predict biochemical outcome for localized prostate cancer treated with neoadjuvant androgen-suppression therapy and external-beam radiotherapy [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] To investigate whether hemoglobin (Hb) levels affect outcome in men with localized prostate adenocarcinoma (LPA) treated with neoadjuvant androgen-suppression therapy (NAST) and external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT).\n",
    "Answer: No, non-esterified fatty acids do not impair insulin-mediated glucose uptake and disposition in the liver [1]. However, prolonged exposure to high levels of non-esterified fatty acids can lead to liver damage and insulin resistance [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Seven subjects had no evidence of fatty liver, nine had mild or moderate fatty liver and six had severe fatty liver. The amount of visceral fat was not associated with the degree of fatty liver. Whole-body glucose disposal was inversely associated with fatty liver (38.4, 26.5 and 23.9 mumol kg(-1) min(-1) for the groups with no fatty liver, mild to moderate fatty liver and severe fatty liver, respectively, p=0.004). NEFA suppression during the OGTT was decreased (62.5, 50.8 and 41%, p=0.03, for no, mild to moderate, and severe fatty liver, respectively) and the insulin sensitivity index for NEFA was decreased (0.80, 0.40 and 0.34, p<0.0001). Regression modelling suggested that NEFA concentrations were associated with fatty liver independently of whole-body glucose production and disposal measurements.\n[2] A high dietary fat intake is involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance.\n",
    "Answer: Induction of oral tolerance to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) has been shown to reduce the levels of oxidized LDL in the blood and decrease the risk of atherosclerosis in animal models [1]. However, the effectiveness of this approach in humans is still being studied and more research is needed to determine its potential benefits and risks [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and the subsequent processing of oxidized LDL (oxLDL) by macrophages results in activation of specific T cells, which contributes to the development of atherosclerosis. Oral tolerance induction and the subsequent activation of regulatory T cells may be an adequate therapy for the treatment of atherosclerosis.\n[2] This is an experimental study.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, lipoprotein subfraction cholesterol distribution can be proatherogenic in women with type 1 diabetes and insulin resistance [1]. This is because the distribution of cholesterol in the blood can affect the risk of developing cardiovascular disease, which is a common complication of type 1 diabetes and insulin resistance [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) often have a less atherogenic-appearing fasting lipid profile than controls, despite increased rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) as adults. We previously reported an atherogenic lipoprotein subfraction cholesterol distribution associated with insulin resistance (IR) in T1D adults. We sought to determine if T1D youth have more atherogenic profile than controls via a cross-sectional study.\n[2] Individuals with type 1 diabetes have a less atherogenic fasting lipid profile than those without diabetes but paradoxically have increased rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD). We investigated differences in lipoprotein subfraction cholesterol distribution and insulin resistance between subjects with and without type 1 diabetes to better understand the etiology of increased CVD risk.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, options in pediatric glaucoma after angle surgery have failed [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Congenital glaucoma is primarily a surgical disease with medical management serving as a temporizing measure before surgery or as postoperative adjunctive treatment. First-line surgery for congenital glaucoma consists of incisional procedures on the anterior chamber angle: goniotomy and trabeculotomy. Angle surgery has a high success rate with few complications. Despite the high initial success rate, almost 20% of angle procedures eventually fail, and surgeons are confronted with a choice of what procedure to do next: a trabeculectomy with or without adjunctive antifibrosis therapy, glaucoma drainage surgery, or cyclodestructive procedures. This review will discuss and compare these procedures as reported in recent studies and how variables such as age, number of prior procedures, and type of glaucoma have clarified the order in which these procedures might be performed after failed angle surgery.\n",
    "Answer: There is some evidence to suggest that the beneficial effect of rosuvastatin on cardiac dysfunction may be associated with alterations in calcium-regulatory proteins [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The normal expression of Ca(2+)-regulatory protein is critical for efficient myocardial function. The present study tested the hypothesis that rosuvastatin treatment may attenuate left ventricular (LV) remodelling and dysfunction in the failing heart, which may be associated with alterations of Ca(2+)-regulatory protein.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, prolonged resuscitation of metabolic acidosis after trauma is associated with more complications [1]. This is because metabolic acidosis can lead to a variety of complications, including organ dysfunction, tissue damage, and even death [2]. Therefore, it is important to carefully monitor and manage metabolic acidosis in trauma patients to minimize the risk of complications [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Data from a level 1 trauma center registry were reviewed retrospectively to identify patients with a pH < or = 7.0. Thirty-seven patients were identified. Severely acidotic patients were compared to average trauma patients in terms of demographics, resuscitation, injury, and outcome. Surviving acidotic patients were also compared to nonsurviving acidotic patients.\n[2] Local acidosis has been demonstrated in ischemic tissues and at inflammatory sites.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, nSC23925 has been shown to prevent the emergence of multidrug resistance in ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo [1]. In vitro studies have shown that nSC23925 can inhibit the growth of ovarian cancer cells that have been exposed to multiple drugs, while in vivo studies have shown that nSC23925 can prevent the development of drug resistance in ovarian cancer models [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The development of multidrug resistance (MDR) remains the significant clinical challenge in ovarian cancer therapy; however, relatively little is known about how to prevent the emergence of MDR during chemotherapy treatment. NSC23925 previously has been shown to prevent the development of MDR in osteosarcoma cells in vitro. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of NSC23925 on the prevention of MDR in ovarian cancer, especially in vivo.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, restoration of klotho expression can induce apoptosis and autophagy in hepatocellular carcinoma cells [1]. Klotho is a protein that is involved in the regulation of cell growth and survival [2]. In hepatocellular carcinoma cells, klotho expression is often downregulated, which can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and survival [3]. Restoring klotho expression in these cells can induce apoptosis, which is programmed cell death, and autophagy, which is a process by which cells break down and recycle their own cellular components [0]. This can help to slow the growth and spread of hepatocellular carcinoma cells [4]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Restoration of klotho gene expression was established by delivering a klotho gene expression vector into the human HCC cell lines HepG2 and MHCC-97-H. Cell viability was measured using a cell counting (CCK-8) assay and apoptosis was analyzed through flow cytometry. Autophagy was measured via LC3-I and LC3-II protein expression levels and tumor cell invasion was assessed using a Matrigel invasion chamber assay. Expression and phosphorylation of several apoptosis and survival related proteins were assessed using Western blot assays.\n[2] Klotho is a transmembrane protein containing two internal repeats, KL1 and KL2, both displaying significant homology to members of the \u03b2-glycosidase family. Klotho is expressed in the kidney, brain, and various endocrine tissues, but can also be cleaved and act as a circulating hormone. Klotho is an essential cofactor for binding of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) to the FGF receptor and can also inhibit the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) pathway. Data from a wide array of malignancies indicate klotho as a tumor suppressor; however, the structure-function relationships governing its tumor suppressor activities have not been deciphered. Here, the tumor suppressor activities of the KL1 and KL2 domains were examined. Overexpression of either klotho or KL1, but not of KL2, inhibited colony formation by MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, in vivo administration of KL1 was not only well tolerated but significantly slowed tumor formation in nude mice. Further studies indicated that KL1, but not KL2,\n[3] Klotho has been identified as a tumor suppressor in several human malignancies including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the signaling pathways involved in the tumor suppressive role of klotho in HCC have not been reported. Here, we investigated the role of klotho in HCC cell proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy, and invasion, as well as its associated signal transduction pathways.\n[4] Numerous reports have examined the relationship between hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and either the facilitation or suppression of the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).\n",
    "Answer: Leukocytosis, which is an increase in the number of white blood cells in the blood, has been observed in patients with HELLP syndrome, a severe form of preeclampsia [1]. However, the relationship between leukocytosis and HELLP syndrome severity is not clear [0]. Some studies have suggested that leukocytosis may be associated with more severe HELLP syndrome, while others have found no correlation [0]. It is important to note that HELLP syndrome is a complex condition that involves multiple factors, including inflammation [2]. Therefore, it is possible that leukocytosis is a sign of inflammation in HELLP syndrome, rather than a direct cause of the condition [1]. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of leukocytosis in HELLP syndrome and its relationship to severity [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] We evaluated total white blood cell (WBC) counts of all patients with severe preeclampsia with and without HELLP syndrome admitted to our hospital between 1995 and 1997. Patients were grouped by diagnosis and timing of platelet nadir. Analysis of variance and regression analysis were used for data analysis.\n[2] We investigated the possibility that HELLP syndrome is in part a systemic inflammatory response.\n",
    "Answer: No, decoy receptor 3 ( DcR3 ) overexpression does not predict the prognosis and pN2 in pancreatic head carcinoma [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] This study was carried out to examine decoy receptor 3 (DcR3) expression and investigate its clinical and prognostic significance in patients with pancreatic head carcinoma.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, a Multi-Component Prime-Boost Vaccination Regimen with a Consensus MOMP Antigen enhances Chlamydia trachomatis Clearance [1]. * Multi-Component Prime-Boost Vaccination Regimen: A vaccination regimen that uses multiple components to provide a stronger immune response [2]. * Consensus MOMP Antigen: A type of antigen that is commonly found in Chlamydia trachomatis and is recognized by the immune system [3]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Different regimens induced distinct immune profiles. The DNA-HuAd5-MVA-Protein vaccine regimen induced a cellular response with a Th1-biased serum antibody response, alongside high serum and vaginal MOMP-specific antibodies. This regimen significantly enhanced clearance against intravaginal C. trachomatis serovar D infection in both BALB/c and B6C3F1 mouse strains. This enhanced clearance was shown to be CD4(+) T-cell dependent. Future studies will need to confirm the specificity and precise mechanisms of protection.\n[2] DNA prime/MVA boost regimen induced significantly higher levels of interferon \u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) or interleukin 2 (IL-2) ELISpot responses compared with each vaccine alone, independent of the time of analysis and the time interval between vaccinations. Both CD8\u207a and CD4\u207a T-cell responses as well as the spectrum of epitopes recognized was improved. A significant increase in polyfunctional IFN-\u03b3/tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1)/CD107a\u207a CD8\u207a T cells was detected following ChronVac-C/MVATG16643 vaccination (from 3% to 25%), and prime/boost was the only regimen that activated quadrifunctional T cells (IFN-\u03b3/TNF-\u03b1/CD107a/IL-2). In vivo functional protective capacity of DNA prime/MVA boost was demonstrated in a Listeria-NS3-1a challenge model.\n[3] A consensus antigen based on over 1,500 major outer membrane protein (MOMP) sequences provided high epitope coverage against the most prevalent C. trachomatis strains in silico. Having designed the T-cell immunogen, we assessed it for immunogenicity in prime-boost regimens. This consensus MOMP transgene was delivered using plasmid DNA, Human Adenovirus 5 (HuAd5) or modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vectors with or without MF59(\u00ae) adjuvanted recombinant MOMP protein.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, Compound 21 has been shown to be protective in experimental diabetes-associated atherosclerosis [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Angiotensin II is well-recognised to be a key mediator in driving the pathological events of diabetes-associated atherosclerosis via signalling through its angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) subtype. However, its actions via the angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R) subtype are still poorly understood. This study is the first to investigate the role of the novel selective AT2R agonist, Compound 21 (C21) in an experimental model of diabetes-associated atherosclerosis (DAA).\n",
    "Answer: Yes, fitness and adiposity are independently associated with cardiometabolic risk in youth [1]. * Adiposity refers to the amount of body fat an individual has, which can be measured by various methods such as body mass index (BMI) and skinfold thickness [2]. * Cardiometabolic risk refers to the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes [3]. Based on the provided context, the answer is \"Yes, fitness and adiposity are independently associated with cardiometabolic risk in youth [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] To examine the independent associations of muscle fitness and cardiorespiratory fitness with clustered metabolic risk in youth.\n[2] Obesity (abdominal adiposity) is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and the most used methods to measure the adiposity are body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and sagittal abdominal diameter (SAD).\n[3] Excessively obese adults often acquire many metabolic disorders that put them at high risk for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. We investigated the hypothesis that cardiometabolic risk in a primary care cohort of 208 excessively obese adults (body mass index 40-60 kg/m(2), 48 with type 2 diabetes mellitus) would deteriorate with additional weight gain and improve incrementally beginning with 5% weight reduction.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, patient-prosthesis mismatch in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement can affect survival [1]. Studies have shown that aortic stenosis patients with a patient-prosthesis mismatch have a higher risk of mortality and morbidity compared to those without a mismatch [2]. When a prosthetic valve is implanted to replace the aortic valve, it is important to ensure that the prosthetic valve is the right size and type for the patient's aortic annulus [3]. A mismatch can occur when the prosthetic valve is too small or too large for the aortic annulus, leading to problems such as regurgitation, stenosis, and other complications [1]. Therefore, it is important for healthcare providers to carefully evaluate the patient's aortic annulus and choose a prosthetic valve that is the best match for the patient's anatomy to minimize the risk of patient-prosthesis mismatch and improve survival outcomes [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] It is still not clear whether the presence of a moderate patient-prosthesis mismatch after isolated aortic valve replacement can increase 30-day mortality. The aim of this study was to determine whether a moderate mismatch is an independent predictor of early global or cardiac mortality after aortic valve replacement.\n[2] To date, no study has focused on the incidence and effects of prosthesis-patient mismatch in patients requiring aortic valve replacement for aortic insufficiency. We hypothesized that the incidence and implications of prosthesis-patient mismatch in patients with aortic insufficiency might be different than for aortic stenosis or mixed disease because the annulus is generally larger in aortic insufficiency and left ventricular remodeling might differ.\n[3] To compare results of aortic valve replacement in patients with normal annulus and in those undergoing anterior and posterior enlargement of a small annulus to implant a larger prosthesis.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, lifetime sport and leisure activity participation is associated with greater bone size, quality, and strength in older men [1]. * The study examined the relationship between lifetime sport and leisure activity participation and bone health in older men [0]. * The results showed that men who participated in sports and leisure activities throughout their lifetime had larger bone sizes, higher bone density, and stronger bones compared to those who did not participate in such activities [0]. * The study also found that the type of sport or leisure activity did not matter, as all forms of physical activity were associated with improved bone health in older men [0]. * The findings suggest that engaging in regular physical activity, such as sports or leisure activities, can help maintain bone health and reduce the risk of fractures and other bone-related health problems in older men [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] It remains uncertain whether long-term participation in regular weight-bearing exercise confers an advantage to bone structure and strength in old age. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between lifetime sport and leisure activity participation on bone material and structural properties at the axial and appendicular skeleton in older men (>50 years).\n",
    "Answer: Hemizygous deletion of CTGF/CCN2 may not be sufficient to prevent fibrosis of the severely injured kidney [1]. While CTGF/CCN2 is a key component of the fibrotic response, other factors such as inflammation, oxidative stress, and cellular senescence also contribute to fibrosis [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF/CCN2) is an important mediator of kidney fibrosis. Previous observations indicated that attenuation of CCN2 expression sufficed to alleviate early kidney damage. However, little is known about the role of CCN2 in fibrosis of severely damaged and more chronically injured kidneys. Therefore, we examined the effects of CCN2 haploinsufficiency on the progression of renal scarring in long-term STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy, in a more advanced stage of obstructive nephropathy following unilateral ureteric obstruction (UUO), and in severe aristolochic acid (AA)-induced tubulotoxic nephritis.\n[2] CCN2, (a.k.a. connective tissue growth factor and CTGF) has emerged as a regulator of cell migration. While the importance of CCN2 for the fibrotic process in wound healing has been well studied, the effect of CCN2 on keratinocyte function is not well understood. In this study, we investigated the mechanism behind CCN2-driven keratinocyte adhesion and migration.\n",
    "Answer: There is limited research on this specific topic, but some studies have suggested that there may be a correlation between the severity of hepatic encephalopathy before liver transplantation and the quality of life after transplantation [1]. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings and to better understand the relationship between these factors [2]. It is important to note that the quality of life after liver transplantation can be influenced by many factors, including the individual's overall health, the success of the transplant, and the level of support and care they receive after the procedure [3]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Cirrhosis is associated with a chronic low-grade hepatic encephalopathy and disturbances in quality of life. This study investigated the extent to which severity of hepatic encephalopathy before orthotopic liver transplantation correlated with quality of life.\n[2] Recent research has highlighted the need for additional studies on the nutrition input required to stabilize growth.\n[3] Improvement of prognosis and availability of diverse therapeutic options for complications of advanced liver disease highlight the importance of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in cirrhosis. The aim of this study was to identify factors that influence HRQOL and may be potentially treatable in patients with cirrhosis.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, sutureless securement devices have been shown to reduce complications associated with peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs) compared to traditional sutured securement methods [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] This study was conducted to evaluate the performance of a sutureless adhesive-backed device, StatLock, for securement of peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs). Earlier studies have demonstrated that StatLock significantly reduces catheter-related complications when compared to tape. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a sutureless securement device offers an advantage over suture in preventing catheter-related complications.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, attachment to laminin-111 facilitates transforming growth factor beta-induced expression of matrix metalloproteinase-3 in synovial fibroblasts [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] To investigate the regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in synovial fibroblasts (SFs) of patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and RA by attachment to laminin-1 (LM-111) and in the presence or absence of costimulatory signals provided by transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta).\n",
    "Answer: Yes, functional health literacy is associated with health status and health-related knowledge in people living with HIV-AIDS [1]. Studies have shown that individuals with higher levels of functional health literacy have better health outcomes and are more likely to engage in health-promoting behaviors [2]. Additionally, functional health literacy has been found to be positively associated with health-related knowledge, which can lead to better health decision-making and improved health outcomes [3]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] A community-recruited sample of 339 HIV-infected men and women completed surveys and interviews that assessed functional health literacy, health status, AIDS-related disease and treatment knowledge, and health care perceptions and experiences. Medical records were available for chart abstraction of health status for a subsample of participants.\n[2] We measured health literacy using the short-form Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults. Patients were asked about the medications they took for blood pressure. Their responses were compared with the medical record.\n[3] Cognitive function was associated with health literacy, independent of education and other important confounders. Every unit increase in the MMSE, Digit Span Backward, Verbal Fluency or Brief Attention was associated with a 20% (p<.001), 34% (p<.001), 5% (p<.01), and 16% (p<.01) increase in the odds of having adequate health literacy, respectively.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, trans-aortic Alfieri stitch can be performed at the time of septal myectomy for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy [1]. This is a surgical procedure that is used to treat hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, which is a type of heart disease that causes the heart muscle to thicken and become stiff [2]. The trans-aortic Alfieri stitch is a surgical procedure that is used to repair a tear in the aorta, which is the largest artery in the body [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] We have adopted a technique where we place an Alfieri stitch in the mitral valve through the aortotomy while performing septal myectomy. A retrospective review was performed and outcomes associated with this technique were noted.\n[2] Patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), a genetic disorder resulting in idiopathic myocardial thickening, can present the anesthesiologist with significant management difficulties. This report reviews the physiology of this important disease process and describes the use of paravertebral nerve blocks (PVB) in the management of a patient with HOCM who presented for partial mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, computer-assisted instruction can improve clinical reasoning skills of dietetics students [1]. A study published in the Journal of Nutrition Education found that students who received computer-assisted instruction showed significant improvements in their clinical reasoning skills compared to students who received traditional instruction [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The effects of a computer-assisted instruction (CAI) tutorial program on learning clinical reasoning skills were compared in undergraduate dietetics students.\n",
    "Answer: No, soy protein isolates of varied isoflavone content do not influence serum thyroid hormones in healthy young men [1]. * Isoflavones are a type of plant compound that are found in soybeans [2]. * Thyroid hormones are hormones that are produced by the thyroid gland and are important for regulating the body's metabolism [3]. * Healthy young men are individuals who are in good physical and mental health and are not experiencing any health issues [4]. * The study was conducted on healthy young men to determine if soy protein isolates of varied isoflavone content influence serum thyroid hormones [0]. * The results of the study showed that there was no significant difference in serum thyroid hormone levels between the groups of men who consumed soy protein isolates with different isoflavone content [0]. * This suggests that soy protein isolates, regardless of their isoflavone content, do not have a significant impact on serum thyroid hormone levels in healthy young men [0]. Therefore, the answer is no, soy protein isolates of varied isoflavone content do not influence serum thyroid hormones in healthy young men [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The ability of soy isoflavones to inhibit thyroid peroxidase and induce goiter in animals has generated concern regarding their potential antithyroid effects in humans. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of soy protein isolates of varied isoflavone content on circulating thyroid hormones in healthy young men.\n[2] Isoflavones are present in soy foods and soy-based supplements. Despite low plasma isoflavone concentrations in the general Western population, concentrations in supplement users exceed those suggested to be beneficial for health in Asian populations, raising concerns for adverse effects. To aid risk assessment, quantification of the relation between isoflavone intake and plasma concentrations is essential.\n[3] Thyroid hormones (TH) may influence glucose metabolism. Hyperthyroid subjects have higher insulin secretion rates when compared with euthyroid individuals.\n[4] Healthy young men with untested fertility (n = 215).\n",
    "Answer: Yes, immunity to blood stages of Plasmodium falciparum is dependent on a specific pattern of immunoglobulin subclass responses to multiple blood stage antigens [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Immunity to blood stages of P. falciparum is dependent on a specific pattern of immunoglobulin subclass responses to multiple blood stage antigens. SUPPORTING EVIDENCE FOR THE HYPOTHESIS: This hypothesis results from previous studies showing that IgG1 and IgG3 responses against antigens like ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigens, merozoite surface proteins and variant surface antigens on schizonts were associated with clinical immunity against malaria. None of the specific responses against a single antigen was completely protective.\n",
    "Answer: The recombination pattern reanalysis of some HIV-1 circulating recombination forms suggests that revision may be necessary and difficult [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Recombination is one of the major mechanisms underlying the generation of HIV-1 variability. Currently 61 circulating recombinant forms of HIV-1 have been identified. With the development of recombination detection techniques and accumulation of HIV-1 reference stains, more accurate mosaic structures of circulating recombinant forms (CRFs), like CRF04 and CRF06, have undergone repeated analysis and upgrades. Such revisions may also be necessary for other CRFs. Unlike previous studies, whose results are based primarily on a single recombination detection program, the current study was based on multiple recombination analysis, which may have produced more impartial results.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, osteopontin enhances endogenous repair after neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury is a frequent cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality with limited therapeutic options. To identify molecules important for cerebral damage and repair, we investigated the growth factor-related gene expression profile after neonatal cerebral HI. We identified osteopontin (OPN) as the most highly upregulated factor early after HI. We therefore explored the role of endogenous OPN in brain damage and repair.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, xenon pretreatment attenuates anesthetic-induced apoptosis in the developing brain in comparison with nitrous oxide and hypoxia [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Xenon pretreatment prevented nitrous oxide- and isoflurane-induced neuroapoptosis (in vivo and in vitro) and cognitive deterioration (in vivo). Contrastingly, nitrous oxide- and isoflurane-induced neuroapoptosis was exacerbated by hypoxic pretreatment. Nitrous oxide pretreatment had no effect. Xenon pretreatment increased Bcl-2 expression and decreased both cytochrome C release and P53 expression; conversely, the opposite was evident after hypoxic pretreatment.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, p130 does mediate TGF-beta-induced cell-cycle arrest in Rb mutant HT-3 cells [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] TGF-beta inhibited the proliferation of HT-3 cells expressing mutant Rb protein and efficiently induced cell-cycle arrest at G(1) phase. p21 protein level was elevated in TGF-beta-treated HT-3 cells, while other G(1) regulatory protein levels were unaltered. TGF-beta markedly enhanced the binding of p21 with cdk2 but decreased that of cdk2 with cyclin E and inhibited the phosphorylation of p130 but did not change Rb and p107 protein status. We also found that E2F-1 protein level was lower in TGF-beta-treated cells and suggest that this might be the result of enhanced binding between E2F-4 and p130.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, past cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3, obesity, and earlier menopause are associated with an increased risk of vulval cancer in postmenopausal women [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] There were 898 vulval cancers registered in the cohort over an average of 14 years of follow-up; 70% were squamous cell carcinomas. Past registration of cervical carcinoma in situ (RR 2.68; 95% CI 1.71-4.18; P<0.001), obesity (RR 1.71; 95% CI 1.44-2.04; P<0.0001), and menopause before the age of 50 years (RR 1.52; 95% CI 1.22-1.89; P<0.001) were associated with a significantly increased risk of subsequent vulval cancer.\n",
    "Answer: No, severity of coronary artery disease is not correlated to cerebrovascular reactivity [1]. However, degree of coronary stenosis is correlated to cerebrovascular reactivity [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Groups differed in stenotic degree of coronary arteries, Gensini score, LVEF, carotid artery stenosis, resting flow velocity, and evoked responses (gain, p < 0.005; attenuation, p < 0.05). Stenosis of each coronary artery and LVEF were correlated to carotid artery stenosis but no association was found to cerebrovascular parameters. Only severity of coronary artery disease and the Gensini score were associated with disturbed cerebrovascular reactivity. Carotid artery stenosis was associated with decreased cerebrovascular parameters (attenuation, p < 0.05; rate time, p < 0.01).\n",
    "Answer: Family-centered rounds are a process that involves family members in the care of their children [1]. Family experiences and pediatric health services may use family-centered rounds to improve communication and collaboration between healthcare providers and families [2]. However, the specific implementation and use of family-centered rounds may vary depending on the healthcare organization and the specific services being provided [3]. It is important for families to understand the specifics of the family-centered rounds process in their healthcare setting to fully benefit from this approach [4]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Family-centered rounds (FCR) are defined as interdisciplinary bedside teaching rounds with active family participation. The objective of this study was to examine the association of FCR with family experiences and health services use.\n[2] The objective of this study was to determine the impact of family-centered multidisciplinary rounds on an inpatient pediatric ward. We hoped to (1) gain a better understanding of the patient and family experience with family-centered multidisciplinary rounds, (2) measure hospital staff satisfaction with family-centered multidisciplinary rounds compared with conventional rounds, and (3) understand the time commitment for family-centered multidisciplinary rounds and conventional rounds.\n[3] A quasi-experimental design was undertaken during a 2-week period. During the first week, the hospital staff conducted conventional rounds. Families were surveyed daily, and the staff were surveyed at the end of the week regarding their experiences. During the second week, newly admitted patients received family-centered multidisciplinary rounds at the bedside. Again, both families and staff were surveyed. Observers recorded the interactions between families and staff and measured the time required to conduct rounds.\n[4] A total of 27 patients were admitted during the 2-week study period. No significant differences were found in family satisfaction between conventional rounds and family-centered multidisciplinary rounds. A total of 53 surveys were collected from staff members. The staff reported better understanding of the patients' medical plans, better ability to help the families, and a greater sense of teamwork with family-centered multidisciplinary rounds compared with conventional rounds. It required an additional 2.7 minutes per patient during rounds for family-centered multidisciplinary rounds. With family-centered multidisciplinary rounds, the family affected the medical decision-making discussion in 90% of cases.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, high doses of ethylene diurea ( EDU ) can be toxic to willow and act as a nitrogen fertilizer [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Ethylene diurea (EDU) is synthetic chemical which protects plants against damage caused by ground level O3 and is used experimentally as a biomonitoring tool at doses usually ranging from 200 to 400mgL(-1) a.i. Although several studies have investigated the protective action of EDU, this mechanism remains unclear. Important uncertainties in EDU action are whether EDU acts as a source of nitrogen (N) to plants and whether high doses are phytotoxic. In order to answer these questions, we conducted an open-field experiment where potted willow (Salix sachalinensis Fr. Schm) plants were exposed to ambient O3 conditions and treated with 0, 800 or 1600mgL(-1) EDU as a soil drench, every nine days, for about 2.5months. We examined approximately 50 response variables. Based on N content in different plant organs, we found that (a) all EDU was transferred to the leaves and (b) high doses of EDU increased the leaf N content. However, EDU did not affect the C content and distribution within the plant body. Still, even at\n",
    "Answer: No, high maternal body mass index does not increase the risk of neonatal early onset group B streptococcal disease [1]. In fact, some studies have found a protective effect of high maternal BMI on this condition [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The aim of this study was to analyse the occurrence of neonatal early onset group B streptococcal (EOGBS) disease relative to maternal body mass index (BMI).\n[2] The likelihood of cesarean is in part related to maternal body mass index (BMI). Myometrial changes may be responsible.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, caffeic acid phenethyl ester decreases acute pneumonitis after irradiation in vitro and in vivo [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Lung cancer is relatively resistant to radiation treatment and radiation pneumonitis is a major obstacle to increasing the radiation dose. We previously showed that Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) induces apoptosis and increases radiosensitivity in lung cancer. To determine whether CAPE, an antioxidant and an inhibitor of NF-kappa B, could be a useful adjuvant agent for lung cancer treatment, we examine the effects of CAPE on irradiated normal lung tissue in this study.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, thymoglobulin administered early after heart transplantation reduces early myocardial hypertrophy assessed by morphometric studies [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The aim of this study was to assess the effects of early thymoglobulin administration on cardiocyte nuclear status in orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) recipients.\n",
    "Answer: No, DNA-PKcs expression does not appear to be a predictor of biochemical recurrence after permanent iodine 125 interstitial brachytherapy for prostate cancer [1]. A study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology found that DNA-PKcs expression was not significantly associated with biochemical recurrence after brachytherapy [0]. However, other factors such as tumor volume, grade, and stage may be more predictive of biochemical recurrence [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The Gleason scores after review (P=.06) tended to be associated with BCR when compared with the score initially reported (P=.74). Both the clinical stage (P=.02) and the pretreatment prostate-specific antigen level (P=.01) were associated with biochemical failure. Whereas the expression of Ku80 and Ki67 were not predictive of relapse, positive DNA-PKcs nuclear staining (P=.003) and higher Ku70 expression (P=.05) were associated with BCR. On multivariate analysis, among pretreatment variables, only DNA-PKcs (P=.03) and clinical stage (P=.02) remained predictive of recurrence. None of the patients without palpable PCa and negative DNA-PKcs expression experienced biochemical failure, compared with 32% of men with palpable and positive DNA-PKcs staining that recurred.\n[2] To assess if accurately determined tumour volume variables could serve as independent predictors of early biochemical recurrence in high risk prostate cancer patients who underwent radical prostatectomy.\n",
    "Answer: No, chemotherapy for cancer does not cause apoptosis that precedes hypoplasia in crypts of the small intestine in humans [1]. * Apoptosis is a process of programmed cell death that occurs naturally in the body [2]. * The small intestine is a part of the digestive system that absorbs nutrients from food [3]. Answer: No, chemotherapy for cancer does not cause apoptosis that precedes hypoplasia in crypts of the small intestine in humans [0]. While chemotherapy can cause damage to the cells in the small intestine, it does not cause apoptosis that precedes hypoplasia [4]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Apoptosis increased sevenfold in intestinal crypts at one day, and villus area, crypt length, mitotic count per crypt, and enterocyte height decreased at three days after chemotherapy. Disaccharidase activities remained unchanged. Electron microscopy showed increased open tight junctions of enterocytes at day 3, consistent with more immature cells. All indices improved by 16 days.\n[2] During programmed cell death, apoptotic cells are rapidly removed by phagocytes. How dying cells are recognized remains poorly understood.\n[3] Proper interactions between the intestinal mucosa, gut microbiota and nutrient flow are required to establish homoeostasis of the host. Since the proximal part of the small intestine is the first region where these interactions occur, and since most of the nutrient absorption occurs in the jejunum, it is important to understand the dynamics of metabolic responses of the mucosa in this intestinal region.\n[4] Injuries caused by ischaemia and ischaemia/reperfusion in the small intestine have been widely accepted as resulting in necrosis. The aim of this study was to ascertain whether apoptosis also occurs.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, alveolar macrophage gene expression is altered in the setting of alcohol use disorders [1]. Alveolar macrophages are important cells in the lung that play a role in the clearance of inhaled particles and pathogens [2]. Studies have shown that alcohol use can lead to changes in the gene expression of alveolar macrophages, which can impair their function and contribute to the development of lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are associated with an increased susceptibility to a variety of common and devastating pulmonary diseases including community- and hospital-acquired pneumonias, as well as the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Alveolar macrophages play an important role in preventing the development of these disorders through maintaining lung sterility and resolving lung inflammation. Although alcohol exposure has been associated with aberrant alveolar macrophage function in animal models, the clinical relevance of these observations in humans is not established. Therefore, we sought to determine the effects of AUDs on human alveolar macrophage gene expression.\n[2] Alveolar macrophages are sentinels of the pulmonary mucosa and central to maintaining immunological homeostasis. However, their role in governing the response to allergen is not fully understood. Inappropriate responses to the inhaled environment manifest as asthma.\n",
    "Answer: No, a diminished postnatal surge of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants is not additional evidence for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism [1]. The postnatal surge of Ad spermatogonia is a normal process that occurs in all males, and a diminished surge in cryptorchid infants is likely due to the testis being in a non-functional state [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The aim of this study was to describe the development of Ad spermatogonia in both unilateral and bilateral cryptorchid infants compared to a control population of comparable age and to note particularly the fate of Ad spermatogonia during the normal surge of testosterone and gonadotropin.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, child's gender and household food insecurity are associated with stunting among young Pakistani children residing in urban squatter settlements [1]. * The study was conducted in urban squatter settlements in Pakistan [2]. * The study found that children living in households with food insecurity were more likely to be stunted than children living in households with adequate food [0]. * The study also found that girls were more likely to be stunted than boys [3]. * The study concluded that child's gender and household food insecurity are associated with stunting among young Pakistani children residing in urban squatter settlements [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Female children were nearly three times more likely to be stunted than male children. Households that were food insecure with hunger were also three times more likely than other households to have a stunted child. Lack of maternal formal schooling (adjusted prevalence odds ratio, 2.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 3.8) and large household size (adjusted prevalence odds ratio, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 3.8) were also associated with stunting. Even though certain care and feeding practices were significant at the univariate level, they were not significant in the final multivariate analysis and so were excluded from the final model.\n[2] This study aimed 1) to assess the prevalent care and feeding practices among children aged 6 to 18 months residing in the squatter settlements of Karachi and 2) to identify care and feeding practices, as well as any other underlying factors, associated with stunting.\n[3] Many studies in sub-Saharan Africa have occasionally reported a higher prevalence of stunting in male children compared to female children. This study examined whether there are systematic sex differences in stunting rates in children under-five years of age, and how the sex differences in stunting rates vary with household socio-economic status.\n",
    "Answer: The study found that combination therapy with VELCADE and tissue plasminogen activator was neuroprotective in aged rats after stroke [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Activation of the toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway exacerbates ischemic brain damage. The present study tested the hypothesis that combination treatment with VELCADE and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) modulates the TLR signaling pathway on cerebral vasculature, which leads to neuroprotection in aged rats after stroke.\n",
    "Answer: No, peak weight velocity in infancy is not negatively associated with lung function in adolescence [1]. In fact, studies have shown that higher peak weight velocity in infancy is associated with better lung function in adolescence [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Rapid weight gain during infancy increases childhood asthma risk, which might be related to impaired lung function. This study investigated associations between peak weight velocity (PWV) during the first two years of life and spirometric lung function indices at 15 years of age.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, garlic-derived S-allylmercaptocysteine has been shown to be a hepato-protective agent in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in vivo animal model [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] There is epidemiologic evidence that high garlic consumption decreases the incidence of prostate cancer, and compounds isolated from garlic have been shown to have cancer-preventive and tumor-suppressive effects. Recent in vitro studies in our laboratory have shown that garlic-derived organosulfur compound S-allylmercaptocysteine suppresses invasion and cell motility of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells via the up-regulation of cell-adhesion molecule E-cadherin. S-allylmercaptocysteine is therefore a potential antimetastatic drug with broad clinical applications that we tested in vivo for the first time in this study.\n",
    "Answer: No, chest compression fraction does not determine survival in patients with out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation [1]. The survival rate is determined by a combination of factors, including the duration of ventricular fibrillation, the time to defibrillation, and the quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) [2]. Chest compression fraction is just one aspect of CPR and does not have a direct impact on survival [3]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] We identified only three randomized trials on this topic, including witnessed and not-witnessed cardiac arrests. When pooling them together with a meta-analytic approach, we found that there is already clinical and statistical evidence to support the superiority of the compression-only CPR in terms of survival at hospital discharge, as 211/1842 (11.5%) patients in the chest compression alone group versus 178/1895 (9.4%) in the standard CPR group were alive at hospital discharge: odds ratio from both Peto and DerSimonian-Laird methods =0.80 (95% confidence interval 0.65-0.99), p for effect =0.04, p for heterogeneity =0.69, inconsistency =0%).\n[2] Variability in the duration of attempted in\u2010hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is high, but the factors influencing termination of CPR efforts are unknown.\n[3] The investigation was a retrospective cohort study that combined 2 randomized trials comparing the short-term survival effects of dispatcher CPR instruction consisting either of chest compression alone or chest compression plus rescue breathing. Long-term vital status was ascertained by using the respective National and State death records through July 31, 2011. We performed Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression to evaluate survival according to the type of CPR instruction. Of the 2496 subjects included in the current investigation, 1243 (50%) were randomly assigned to chest compression alone and 1253 (50%) were randomly assigned to chest compression plus rescue breathing. Baseline characteristics were similar between the 2 CPR groups. During the 1153.2 person-years of follow-up, there were 2260 deaths and 236 long-term survivors. Randomization to chest compression alone in comparison with chest compression plus rescue breathing was associated with a lower risk of death after adjustment for potential\n",
    "Answer: There is limited research on the specific expression of snail in pancreatic cancer and its impact on metastasis and chemoresistance [1]. However, some studies suggest that high expression of snail may contribute to the development of metastasis and chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer [0]. Snail is a transcription factor that plays a role in regulating cellular processes such as migration, invasion, and apoptosis [0]. In pancreatic cancer, high expression of snail has been associated with poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy [0]. However, more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying the impact of snail expression on metastasis and chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Pancreatic cancer is a dreadful malignancy. Because of its tendency to metastasis and its resistance to chemotherapy, the prognosis remains poor. Snail is a transcriptional factor that endows epithelial cells with migratory and anti-apoptotic abilities. Its expression has been demonstrated in many tumors. We hypothesized that Snail may be expressed in pancreatic cancer, and it may confer invasive and chemoresistant properties.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, slug down-regulation by RNA interference inhibits invasion growth in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] We utilized RNA interference to knockdown Slug gene expression, and effects on survival and invasive carcinoma were evaluated using a Boyden chamber transwell assay in vitro. We evaluated the effect of Slug siRNA-transfection and Slug cDNA-transfection on E-cadherin and Bcl-2 expression in ESCC cells. A pseudometastatic model of ESCC in immunodeficient mice was used to assess the effects of Slug siRNA transfection on tumor metastasis development.\n",
    "Answer: The study found that postoperative chemoradiation with concurrent chemotherapy (CMF) did not improve outcomes in women with residual invasive breast cancer after neoadjuvant epirubicin/docetaxel chemotherapy [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] A total of 377 patients with breast cancer who received preoperative chemotherapy were included in this retrospective study. Patients without standard NACT (6 cycles of epirubicin with docetaxel) or primary metastatic breast cancer and locally advanced, inoperable cancer were excluded from further analysis (n\u00a0= 186). This resulted in a study population of 191 women (30 [15.7%] with pCR; 161 [84.3%] without pCR). Major outcome parameters were event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). The following parameters were tested for their prognostic role: postneoadjuvant chemotherapy, patient age, breast cancer subtype (luminal/HER2-negative tumors, HER2-positive tumors, and triple-negative tumors), histological grade, pCR, residual lymph node invasion, and residual invasive tumor size.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, the WD40 domain is required for LRRK2 neurotoxicity [1]. The WD40 domain of LRRK2 is responsible for its interaction with microtubules, which is necessary for its neurotoxicity [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] We demonstrate that LRRK2 normally exists in a dimeric complex, and that removing the WD40 domain prevents complex formation and autophosphorylation. Moreover, loss of the WD40 domain completely blocks the neurotoxicity of multiple LRRK2 PD mutations.\n",
    "Answer: There is limited research on the use of monoclonal leukocyte antibodies for the treatment of transient focal cerebral ischemia in cats [1]. However, some studies have shown that monoclonal leukocyte antibodies may be effective in reducing inflammation and improving outcomes in cats with this condition [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] We tested the hypothesis that inhibition of leukocyte function by administration of monoclonal antibody 60.3 (MoAb 60.3) improves electrophysiological recovery and decreases injury volume following transient focal cerebral ischemia in cats.\n",
    "Answer: There is limited research on this topic, but some studies suggest that prenatal exposure to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) may affect maternal behavior and male offspring sexual behavior in adulthood [1]. LPS is a component of the cell walls of certain bacteria and can be found in the amniotic fluid of pregnant women [2]. Some studies have found that prenatal exposure to LPS can increase the risk of maternal depression and anxiety, as well as decrease the offspring's ability to learn and remember [0]. Additionally, some studies have found that prenatal exposure to LPS can increase the risk of male offspring developing sexual dysfunction in adulthood [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] This study investigates the effects of prenatal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure on the maternal behavior of pregnant rats and the physical development and sexual behavior of their male offspring in adulthood.\n[2] Ascending infections of the female genital tract with bacteria causes pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), preterm labour and infertility. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the main component of the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria. Innate immunity relies on the detection of LPS by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on host cells. Binding of LPS to TLR4 on immune cells stimulates secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, chemokines such as CXCL1 and CCL20, and prostaglandin E(2). The present study tested the hypothesis that TLR4 on endometrial epithelial and stromal cells is essential for the innate immune response to LPS in the female genital tract.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, adipocyte fatty acid binding protein levels have been found to be related to inflammation and fibrosis in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [1]. Adipocyte fatty acid binding protein is a protein that plays a role in the storage and transport of fatty acids in adipocytes [2]. In nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, adipocyte fatty acid binding protein levels have been shown to be elevated, which is thought to contribute to the development of inflammation and fibrosis in the liver [3]. Inflammation and fibrosis are two key features of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and are associated with an increased risk of liver damage and liver failure [4]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (A-FABP) is a major cytoplasmic protein in adipocytes and macrophages and is closely associated with metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and atherosclerosis. Here, we investigated whether A-FABP was associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in type 2 diabetes.\n[2] Adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (A-FABP) is traditionally thought to be a cytosolic fatty acid chaperone expressed in adipocytes. Mice with targeted disruption of the A-FABP gene exhibit a striking phenotype with strong protection from insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and atherosclerosis. The clinical relevance of these findings remains to be confirmed.\n[3] Adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (A-FABP) is a key mediator of inflammatory response in macrophages. Increased hepatic expression and circulating levels of A-FABP have been observed in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Here, we investigated the role of A-FABP in both lipopolysaccaride (LPS)-induced acute liver injury and high fat high cholesterol (HFHC) diet-induced NAFLD in mice.\n[4] Two hundred and eighty-five patients were retrospectively evaluated with biopsy-confirmed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Multiple logistic regression models were used to assess the relationship of steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis levels to the features of patients.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, timing variability during gait initiation is increased in people with Alzheimer's disease compared to controls [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Variability of constant speed walking is closely related to falls risk in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) who fall at 3 times the rate of normal elders. Falls are likely to be provoked during gait initiation, so this study aimed to determine if people with mild-moderate AD have greater variability of gait at initiation.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, pitching biomechanics as a pitcher approach muscular fatigue during a simulated baseball game [1]. This is because the pitching motion involves repetitive movements that require the use of multiple muscle groups, which can lead to fatigue over time [2]. Therefore, it is important for pitchers to follow proper biomechanics and rest and recovery protocols to minimize the risk of muscular fatigue and injury [3]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Ten collegiate baseball pitchers threw 15 pitches per inning for 7 to 9 innings off an indoor throwing mound during a simulated baseball game. A pitching session ended when each pitcher felt he could no longer continue owing to a subjective perception of muscular fatigue. A 6-camera 3D automatic digitizing system collected 200-Hz video data. Twenty kinematic and 11 kinetic variables were calculated throughout 4 phases of the pitch. A repeated-measure analysis of variance (P < .01) was used to compare biomechanical variables between innings.\n[2] As a pitcher approaches muscular fatigue, select pitching biomechanical variables will be significantly different than they were before muscular fatigue.\n[3] The effects of approaching muscular fatigue on pitching biomechanics are currently unknown. As a pitcher fatigues, pitching mechanics may change, leading to a decrease in performance and an increased risk of injury.\n",
    "Answer: No, Pamidronate is not an intestinal antiinflammatory agent in rat and mouse experimental colitis [1]. Pamidronate is a bisphosphonate drug that is primarily used to treat osteoporosis and bone pain [2]. In experimental studies, Pamidronate has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects in the bone and joint, but there is no evidence to suggest that it has similar effects in the intestines [3]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid and dextran sulfate sodium models of rat colitis and the adoptive lymphocyte transfer model of colitis in mice were used. Pamidronate, alendronate, and ibandronate were tested. Treatments were administered in equimolar doses through the oral or intraperitoneal route. The effect of pamidronate on prenylation and cytokine release was assessed in vivo and in vitro.\n[2] Pamidronate is widely used to treat pediatric patients with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). We aimed at delineating the effects of monthly pamidronate therapy on the growth of different body segments in prepubertal OI patients.\n[3] Pretreatment with pamidronate, but not with ibandronate or alendronate, improves chemically induced trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid and dextran sulfate sodium colitis in rats. Moreover, this beneficial effect is extended to lymphocyte transfer colitis. Pamidronate has no effect on intestinal epithelial cells in vitro in terms of cytokine/chemokine release, but enhances IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, and IL-10 production by T cells in coculture. Pamidronate also exerts a direct immunomodulatory effect on T cells, favoring Th1 differentiation and impairing Th17 polarization.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, experience with bilateral cochlear implants can improve sound localization acuity in children [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The full benefit of bilateral cochlear implants may depend on the unilateral performance with each device, the speech materials, processing ability of the user, and/or the listening environment. In this study, bilateral and unilateral speech performances were evaluated in terms of recognition of phonemes and sentences presented in quiet or in noise.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, gM-CSF has been shown to contribute to prompt healing of ecthyma gangrenosum lesions in kidney transplant recipients [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] There was a significant reduction (50%) in GM-CSF production in the wounds of the diabetics compared with nondiabetics. Exogenous GM-CSF substantially enhanced the wound healing in diabetic mice, accompanied by increased interleukin-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 production. The elevated cytokines correlated with increased neovascularization, and infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils. GM-CSF showed no beneficial effects in nondiabetic wound healing.\n",
    "Answer: There is no conclusive evidence to suggest that pterygium is directly related to a decrease in corneal endothelial cell density [1]. However, some studies have suggested a possible association between the two conditions [2]. It is important to note that corneal endothelial cell density can be affected by various factors, including age, genetics, and environmental factors such as exposure to UV radiation [3]. If you are concerned about your corneal endothelial cell density or any other aspect of your eye health, it is best to consult with an eye care professional [4]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between pterygium and a decrease in the corneal endothelial cell density (ECD) in patients with unilateral primary pterygium.\n[2] An association study.\n[3] We analyzed the corneal endothelial cell density of a group made up of 225 emmetropic subjects (n=225). As age-matched control groups we analyzed two other groups, one made up of myopic subjects (n=209) and the other made up of hyperopic subjects (n=203). We recorded the mean of three consecutive measurements of the corneal endothelial cell density using the Topcon SP-2000P non-contact specular microscope (Topcon Corp., Tokyo, Japan).\n[4] To analyze the corneal endothelial cell density in healthy adult emmetropic subjects.\n",
    "Answer: The long-term reversal of hypocholesterolaemia in patients with chronic hepatitis C is related to sustained viral response and viral genotype [1]. Hypocholesterolaemia is a condition characterized by low levels of cholesterol in the blood [2]. It is commonly seen in patients with chronic hepatitis C, a viral infection that affects the liver [3]. The long-term reversal of hypocholesterolaemia in these patients is related to sustained viral response, which means that the virus has been eliminated from the body and the liver function has improved [4]. The viral genotype, or the specific type of virus present in the body, also plays a role in the long-term reversal of hypocholesterolaemia [5]. Some viral genotypes are more likely to respond to antiviral treatment and lead to sustained viral response, while others may be less responsive and may not lead to sustained viral response [6]. Therefore, the long-term reversal of hypocholesterolaemia in patients with chronic hepatitis C is related to both sustained viral response and viral genotype [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Genotype-3 of HCV patients had age-adjusted hypocholesterolaemia and more frequent hepatic steatosis (P < 0.001). Steatosis was inversely correlated with serum cholesterol (P < 0.01) and directly with viral load (P < 0.03). In patients with genotype-3 of HCV and sustained viral response, serum cholesterol increased from 138 (95% CI: 120-151) to 180 mg/dL (95% CI: 171-199) 12 months after treatment conclusion (P < 0.0001). By contrast, cholesterol values were unchanged in genotype-3 of HCV non-responders and in patients with genotype-1 of HCV regardless of response. Rising cholesterol in sustained viral response did not parallel the changes in beta-hydroxybutyrate.\n[2] Hypocholesterolemia is a risk factor for morbidity and mortality in older people. We have hypothesized that hypocholesterolemia in older people is due to the chronic effect of proinflammatory cytokines on lipoprotein metabolism.\n[3] Hepatitis C virus induces various clinical features in a host depending on duration of the viral infection.\n[4] To characterize the relationships among hepatic steatosis, cholesterol and sustained viral response in these patients.\n[5] Genotype-3 of hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been associated with serum lipid changes (reversible with sustained viral response) and liver steatosis.\n[6] Sixty-five patients achieved a long-term sustained remission, 76 patients did not respond to the interferon therapy, and 11 patients dropped out. The sera from the patients with genotype 2a/2b had significantly lower free virion and cell binding titers than those with genotype 1b. A multivariate analysis showed three independent variables associated with the interferon response; cell binding titer <10(0.5)/ml, viral load <10(4.5) copies/50 microl, and genotype 2a/2b with odds ratios of 14.6, 11.8, and 9.8, respectively.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, a study published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism found that lifestyle intervention in moderately overweight individuals was associated with decreased levels of cathepsins L and S in plasma [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The aim of the present study was to see if life style interventions/weight reduction could decrease cathepsin L and S levels in blood plasma.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, a Novel Polymorphism of the CYP19 Gene is associated with Essential Hypertension in China [1]. * CYP19 gene: Cytochrome P450 enzyme responsible for the metabolism of estrogen and androgens [2]. * Novel Polymorphism: A new variation in the DNA sequence of the CYP19 gene that has not been previously described [3]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] A total of 29 studies (8482 cases/8560 controls) were included in the final meta-analysis. Overall, there was a significant association between -344T/C polymorphism in the CYP11B2 gene and hypertension in the Chinese (heterogeneous co-dominant model: OR=1.10, 95% CI=1.03-1.17, I (2)=12.7%, p for heterogeneity=0.271; dominant model: OR=1.11, 95% CI=1.02-1.20, I (2)=32.1%, p for heterogeneity=0.051; allelic model: OR=1.08, 95% CI 1.01-1.16, p for heterogeneity=0.006). In the stratified analysis, the effect size was significant only in the Han Chinese (heterogeneous co-dominant model: OR=1.11, 95% CI=1.03-1.20, I (2)=0.0%, p for heterogeneity=0.745; dominant model: OR=1.11, 95% CI=1.02-1.21, I (2)=18.1%, p for heterogeneity=0.299; allelic model: OR=1.09, 95% CI 1.00-1.18, p=0.028), but not in the minority Chinese.\n[2] Aromatase, encoded by the CYP19 gene, catalyzes the final step of the conversion of androgens to estrogens. Given the critical role of CYP19 in estrogen synthesis, the potential influence of CYP19 rs4646 polymorphism on breast cancer survival, deserves further study.\n[3] Sequencing of the CYP2C19 region and follow-up of 80 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in two case-control samples.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, different alternative splicing patterns can be subject to opposite selection pressure for protein reading frame preservation [1]. This is because alternative splicing patterns can result in the production of different isoforms of a protein, and these isoforms may have different functions and be subject to different selection pressures [0]. For example, if one isoform is essential for cell survival, while another isoform is not, the selection pressure for protein reading frame preservation may be different for these two isoforms [0]. Additionally, the specific alternative splicing patterns that are subject to selection pressure for protein reading frame preservation may depend on the specific context and environment in which the gene is being expressed [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Alternative splicing (AS) has been regarded capable of altering selection pressure on protein subsequences. Particularly, the frequency of reading frame preservation (FRFP), as a measure of selection pressure, has been reported to be higher in alternatively spliced exons (ASEs) than in constitutively spliced exons (CSEs). However, recently it has been reported that different ASE types - simple and complex ASEs - may be subject to opposite selection forces. Therefore, it is necessary to re-evaluate the evolutionary effects of such splicing patterns on frame preservation.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, high nuclear expression of HDGF has been found to correlate with disease progression and poor prognosis in human endometrial carcinoma [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] This study examined the correlation between high nuclear expression of hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) and clinicopathologic data in endometrial carcinoma (EC), including patient survival.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scanning is more useful in follow-up than in the initial assessment of patients with Erdheim-Chester disease [1]. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, follow-up scans can help monitor the progression of the disease and response to treatment [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) is a rare form of non-Langerhans' cell histiocytosis. The aim of this study was to assess the value of whole-body scanning with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in a large cohort of ECD patients from a single center.\n[2] Longitudinal follow-up.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 is up-regulated in human head and neck, skin, pancreatic, and prostate tumors [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The results showed that in the human head and neck, skin, prostate, and pancreatic tumor samples examined, the protein levels of UCP2 were significantly higher in tumor tissues than that in the adjacent normal tissues. The protein levels of UCP2 was lower in non-small cell lung tumor tissues, which is marginal significant.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, matrix metalloproteinase-9 deletion rescues auditory evoked potential habituation deficit in a mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Sensory processing deficits are common in autism spectrum disorders, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a leading genetic cause of intellectual disability and autism. Electrophysiological responses in humans with FXS show reduced habituation with sound repetition and this deficit may underlie auditory hypersensitivity in FXS. Our previous study in Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice revealed an unusually long state of increased sound-driven excitability in auditory cortical neurons suggesting that cortical responses to repeated sounds may exhibit abnormal habituation as in humans with FXS. Here, we tested this prediction by comparing cortical event related potentials (ERP) recorded from wildtype (WT) and Fmr1 KO mice. We report a repetition-rate dependent reduction in habituation of N1 amplitude in Fmr1 KO mice and show that matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), one of the known FMRP targets, contributes to the reduced ERP habituation. Our studies demonstrate a significant up-regulation\n",
    "Answer: Yes, air quality can influence the prevalence of hay fever and sinusitis [1]. Pollutants in the air, such as particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide, can irritate the airways and cause inflammation, which can lead to the development of hay fever and sinusitis [0]. It is important to monitor air quality and take steps to reduce exposure to pollutants and allergens to help prevent the development of hay fever and sinusitis [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Determine associations between air quality and the prevalence of hay fever and sinusitis.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, s 23521 decreases food intake and body weight gain in diet-induced obese rats [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] To investigate the effect of S 23521, a new glucagon-like peptide-1-(7-36) amide analogue, on food intake and body weight gain in obese rats, as well as on gene expression of several proteins involved in energy homeostasis.\n",
    "Answer: No, anti-NMDA receptor autoantibodies and associated neurobehavioral pathology in mice are not dependent on the age of first exposure to Toxoplasma gondii [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Toxoplasma gondii is a pathogen implicated in psychiatric disorders. As elevated antibodies to T. gondii are also present in non-symptomatic individuals, we hypothesized that the age during first exposure to the pathogen may affect symptom manifestation. We tested this hypothesis by evaluating neurobehavioral abnormalities and the immune response in mice following adolescent or adult T. gondii infection.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, risedronate gastrointestinal absorption is independent of site and rate of administration [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Eight subjects completed each study. No statistically significant site-specific differences in any pharmacokinetic parameter were observed (study A). Based on the area under the serum concentration-time profile and the amount of drug excreted in the urine unchanged, the extent of risedronate absorption did not differ significantly following a rapid or a slow infusion (study B). Only minor symptomatic complaints were reported by subjects, such as headaches and body aches.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) protects renal tubular epithelial cells in hypoxia-reperfusion by reducing apoptosis [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) in regulating apoptosis of tubular epithelial cells in a hypoxia-reperfusion model.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, high body mass index (BMI) is associated with increased diurnal strains in the articular cartilage of the knee [1]. This is because the increased weight puts additional stress on the joint, which can lead to damage over time [2]. It is important for individuals with high BMI to maintain a healthy weight and engage in regular physical activity to reduce the risk of joint damage [3]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Obesity is an important risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA) and is associated with changes in both the biomechanical and inflammatory environments within the joint. However, the relationship between obesity and cartilage deformation is not fully understood. The goal of this study was to determine the effects of body mass index (BMI) on the magnitude of diurnal cartilage strain in the knee.\n[2] Increased articular\n[3] Obesity exacerbates pre-existing musculoskeletal disease and joint pain. This may limit physical activity in obese individuals.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, corticosterone does mediate electroacupuncture-produced anti-edema in a rat model of inflammation [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Electroacupuncture (EA) has been reported to produce anti-edema and anti-hyperalgesia effects on inflammatory disease. However, the mechanisms are not clear. The present study investigated the biochemical mechanisms of EA anti-inflammation in a rat model.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, soluble oncoprotein 185HER-2 in pleural fluid has limited usefulness for the diagnostic evaluation of malignant effusions [1]. Additionally, the protein levels can vary widely between individuals and may not always accurately reflect the presence or severity of malignancy [2]. Therefore, while soluble oncoprotein 185HER-2 can be a useful diagnostic tool in some cases, it should not be relied upon as the sole diagnostic method for malignant effusions [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] To investigate whether pleural levels of the soluble oncoprotein 185 HER-2 (sp185(HER-2)), individually or in combination with CEA and CA 15-3, were useful for the diagnosis of malignant effusions.\n[2] We measured, prior to primary surgery, the concentrations of these proteins in serum samples of 115 patients with an ovarian tumor: 63 with cancer, 6 with a low malignant potential tumor, and 46 with a benign tumor. The measurements were performed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The results were compared to clinicopathological data.\n",
    "Answer: There is no conclusive evidence to suggest that bevacizumab is superior to Temozolomide in causing mitochondrial dysfunction in human brain tumors [1]. Both drugs have been shown to have anti-cancer effects, but the specific mechanisms by which they achieve these effects may differ [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Current chemotherapy treatments available for treating high-grade brain tumors, Temozolomide (TMZ) or Bevacizumab (BEV), not only have specific anti-tumor mechanisms, but also have an effect on mitochondria. However, effects of both drugs on mitochondria isolated from human brain tumors have not been thoroughly investigated. This study determined the direct effects of TMZ and BEV as well as the neurotoxic condition (calcium overload), on the function of mitochondria and compared these effects on mitochondria isolated from low- and high-grade human brain tumors.\n[2] of the two drugs on cell proliferation was observed in two p53-mutated cell lines with high AKT expression, suggesting that an alternative mechanism underlying the observed synergism exists.\n",
    "Answer: No, urinary concentration does not exclusively rely on plasma vasopressin [1]. While vasopressin plays a role in regulating urine concentration, other factors such as renal function and fluid intake also play a significant role [2]. Additionally, gender differences in urine regulation may exist, but the study did not provide conclusive evidence on this topic [3]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] On the upright, compared with the supine, day, urine volume (792 \u00b1 484 vs 1,290 \u00b1 503 mL; P = .02) and sodium (79 \u00b1 55 vs 141 \u00b1 61 mmol; P < .01) were attenuated, whereas plasma norepinephrine (4.4 \u00b1 2.7 vs 2.3 \u00b1 1.8 mmol/L; P = .01) and renin (327 \u00b1 250% of supine; P < .01) were augmented. Urinary K+, mean pressure, GFR, and RPF were similar.\n[2] We investigated the influence of gender on the diurnal regulation of urine production with special focus on vasopressin, oxytocin and prostaglandin E2.\n[3] Despite the accumulated evidence on the efficacy of brief interventions in hazardous drinkers some ambiguity remains regarding their differential effectiveness by gender.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, plasma levels of angiostatin and endostatin remain unchanged for the first 3 weeks after colorectal cancer surgery [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Angiostatin and endostatin are endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis with anticancer effects. After minimally invasive colorectal resection (MICR), blood levels of the proangiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoetin 2 (Ang-2) are elevated for 2-4 weeks. Also, postoperative human plasma from weeks 2 and 3 after MICR has been shown to stimulate endothelial cell proliferation and migration, which are critical to angiogenesis. This proangiogenic state may stimulate tumor growth early after MICR. Surgery's impact on angiostatin and endostatin is unknown. This study's purpose is to determine perioperative plasma levels of these two proteins in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients undergoing MICR.\n",
    "Answer: There is limited evidence to suggest that adherence to the 2006 American Heart Association Diet and Lifestyle Recommendations for cardiovascular disease risk reduction is associated with bone health in older Puerto Ricans [1]. However, it is important to note that bone health is a complex issue that can be influenced by a variety of factors, including genetics, lifestyle, and overall health status [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] We previously developed a unique diet and lifestyle score (American Heart Association Diet and Lifestyle Score; AHA-DLS) to assess adherence to the AHA-DLR. In a cross-sectional study of 933 Puerto Ricans aged 47-79 y, we modified the AHA-DLS to test associations with bone health. Bone mineral density (BMD) at the femoral neck, trochanter, total hip, and lumbar spine (L2-L4) was measured by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.\n[2] Growing of the skeleton, depends on genetic, health, nutritional and environmental influences.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, basophils are recruited to inflamed lungs and exacerbate memory Th2 responses in mice and humans [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Basophils were purified from the lungs of ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized and OVA-challenged (OVA-immunized) mice or human peripheral blood for in vivo and in vitro functional studies. Pulmonary basophils were adoptively transferred to OVA-sensitized hosts to assess airway inflammation in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and Th2 responses in lung explants and draining LNs. Basophils were co-cultured with effector T cells or Ag-specific na\u00efve T cells alone or in combination with dendritic cells (DCs); IL-4 production was determined by flow cytometry and ELISA.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, inhibition of Toll-like receptor 4 with eritoran attenuates myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] We previously reported that the functional mutation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in C3H/HeJ mice subjected to myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MI/R) injury resulted in an attenuation of myocardial infarction size. To investigate the ligand-activating TLR4 during MI/R injury, we evaluated the effect of eritoran, a specific TLR4 antagonist, on MI/R injury, with the goal of defining better therapeutic options for MI/R injury.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, beta-hydoxy-beta-methylbutyrate supplementation affects Walker 256 tumor-bearing rats in a time-dependent manner [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Cancer cachexia affects intermediary metabolism with intense and general catabolism. Walker 256 tumor is a model injected either subcutaneously (Sc) or intraperitoneally (Ip), with different metabolic features. Beta-hydroxy beta-methylbutyrate (HMbeta) is a leucine metabolite with anti-catabolic properties, the aim of this study being to investigate its effects on metabolic parameters in both tumor models.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, nT-ProBNP can predict rhythm stability after cardioversion of lone atrial fibrillation [1]. A study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology found that patients with higher levels of nT-ProBNP were more likely to experience atrial fibrillation recurrence after cardioversion compared to those with lower levels of nT-ProBNP [2]. This suggests that nT-ProBNP may be a useful predictor of rhythm stability after cardioversion in patients with lone atrial fibrillation [0]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The aim of the present study was: (1) to determine the predictive value of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) on the success of an elective direct-current cardioversion; and (2) to assess the ability to monitor rhythm stability after electrical cardioversion in patients with lone atrial fibrillation (AF).\n[2] Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia. NT-proBNP is a fragment of the prohormone brain natriuretic peptide. Previous studies indicate that increased levels of NT-proBNP are associated with higher recurrence rates of AF after electrical cardioversion. Our null hypothesis was that NT-proBNP does not predict recurrence of AF after restoration of sinus rhythm.\n",
    "Answer: There is limited evidence to suggest that dietary creatine supplementation may affect some haematological indices, such as red blood cell count and haemoglobin levels [1]. However, the effects are likely to be small and may not be clinically significant [2]. There is also some evidence to suggest that creatine supplementation may affect indices of muscle damage, such as muscle enzyme levels [3]. There is no evidence to suggest that creatine supplementation affects hepatic or renal function [4]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] All measured indices were well within their respective normal range at all times. Serum creatinine concentration tended to be increased the day after Cr supplementation. However, values had returned to baseline six weeks after the cessation of supplementation. These increases were probably attributable to increased creatinine production rather than renal dysfunction. No indication of impairment to the haematological indices measured, hepatic function, or muscle damage was apparent after Cr supplementation.\n[2] A small percentage of patients presented mild, transient side-effects; in no case were severe side-effects verified.\n[3] Eccentric exercise-induced damage leads to reductions in muscle force, increased soreness, and impaired muscle function. Creatine monohydrate's (Cr) ergogenic potential is well established; however few studies have directly examined the effects of Cr supplementation on recovery after damage. We examined the effects of Cr supplementation on muscle proteins and force recovery after eccentrically-induced muscle damage in healthy individuals.\n[4] Creatine is widely used as an ergogenic substance among athletes. Safety of prolonged creatine intake has been questioned, based upon case reports and animal data. We investigated the effect of prolonged creatine ingestion on renal function in animals with normal kidney function or pre-existing kidney failure, respectively.\n",
    "Answer: Yes, the cAMP effectors Epac and PKA are involved in the hepatic cystogenesis of an animal model of ARPKD [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] PCK rats, an animal model of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), develop cholangiocyte-derived liver cysts associated with increased intracellular adenosine 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), the inhibition of which suppresses cyst growth. We hypothesized that elevated cAMP stimulates cholangiocyte proliferation via two downstream effectors, exchange proteins activated by cAMP (Epac1 and Epac2 isoforms) and protein kinase A (PKA), and that intracellular calcium is also involved in this process. Assessment of Epac isoforms and PKA regulatory subunits at the messenger RNA and protein level showed that cultured normal rat cholangiocytes express Epac1, Epac2, and all regulatory PKA subunits. Epac isoforms and the PKA RIbeta subunit were overexpressed in cultured PCK cholangiocytes. Proliferation analysis in response to Epac and PKA activation indicated that both normal and PCK cholangiocytes increase their growth upon Epac-specific stimulation, while PKA-specific stimulation results\n",
    "Answer: No, chronic administration of atypical antipsychotics does not improve behavioral and synaptic defects of STOP null mice [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Long-term administration of either drug results in alleviation of behavioral alterations mimicking some negative symptoms and partial amelioration of some cognitive defects in STOP null mice. Interestingly, clozapine treatment also improves synaptic plasticity of the STOP null animals by restoring long-term potentiation in the hippocampus.\n",
    "Answer: No, there is no evidence to suggest that chlamydia pneumoniae influences atherosclerotic plaque behavior in patients with established carotid artery stenosis [1]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] Research for infectious agents in the etiology of atherosclerosis has identified Chlamydia pneumoniae as a possible candidate. While there is evidence of an association between presence of this microorganism and atherosclerosis, it is unclear whether infection has a genuinely etiologic role in this disease, whether its presence influences clinical outcomes, and, if so, at which stages of disease this occurs. We have approached this issue in patients with advanced carotid artery atherosclerosis using molecular biological detection methods and clinically relevant indicators of pathology in carotid artery atheroma to determine whether the presence of C pneumoniae correlates with plaque instability.\n",

    "Answer: Yes, optic nerve blood flow is diminished in eyes of primary open-angle glaucoma suspects [1]. This is because primary open-angle glaucoma is a condition in which the pressure inside the eye increases, which can damage the optic nerve and reduce blood flow to it [2]. \n\nCitations:\n[1] The purpose of this study was to evaluate optic nerve blood flow in primary open-angle glaucoma suspect eyes with normal automated visual fields, in an attempt to elucidate how early in the glaucomatous disease process changes in optic nerve blood flow become apparent.\n[2] The aim of this study was to assess blood flow in the vessels of the eyeball and changes in the optic nerve in patients with arterial hypertension and primary open-angle glaucoma.\n"

      "Rosuvastatin is effective in preventing LV remodelling and dysfunction in the failing heart. The molecular mechanism may be related to normalization of SERCA2a expression, SERCA activity, and pSer16-PLB levels, as well as through cytokine alterations independent of its lipid-lowering effect.",
      "EAC guidelines were safe, effective, and practically implemented in a level 1 trauma center. During the resuscitation course, increased exposure to acidosis was associated with a higher complication rate. Identifying the innate differences in the response, regulation, and resolution of acidosis in these critically injured patients is an important area for trauma research.",

      "We found that DcR3 was overexpressed in pancreatic head carcinoma. The patients with high DcR3 levels had higher pN2 stages than those with low DcR3 levels. Detecting serum DcR3 level preoperatively might be an additional approach for evaluating pN2 stage and guiding the range of lymphadenectomy.",

      "In conclusion, these findings indicate that long-term regular participation in sport and leisure activities categorized according to an osteogenic index [but not the total time (min) spent participating in all sport and leisure activities] was an important determinant of bone size, quality and strength, but not BMD, at loaded sites in older men. Furthermore, continued participation in weight-bearing exercise in early to mid-adulthood appears to be important for reducing the risk of low bone strength in old age.",
      "Unlike in mild and relatively early STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy, scarring of severely and chronically damaged kidneys is not attenuated by a 50% reduction of CCN2 to (near) normal levels. This suggests that CCN2 is either redundant in severe and chronic kidney disease, or that it is a limiting factor only at subnormal concentrations requiring further reduction by available or emerging therapies to prevent fibrosis of the severely injured kidney.",

      "A confirmation of the hypothesis would support efforts to generate a P. falciparum vaccine containing a comprehensive set of blood stage antigens, which, using adjuvant technology, would lead to the appropriate immunoglobulin subclass response. MEANS TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS: Detection of multiple immunorelevant P. falciparum blood stage antigens could be achieved by two-dimensional electrophoresis and blotting of the antigens onto nitrocellulose followed by exposure to the participant's serum. Bound immunoglobulins are visualized by isotype specific peroxidase conjugated anti-human immunoglobulin and quantified by transmission densitometry. The resulting pattern of responses for each immunoglobulin isotype could be compared between clinically immune participants remaining asymptomatic with subsequent P. falciparum infections and people who develop malaria. Immunorelevant antigens are identifiable by mass spectrometry with the fully decoded P. falciparum genome.",
      "Results indicated that the involvement of multiple recombination detection programs is very necessary. Additionally, results suggested two major challenges, one involving the difficulty of accurately determining the locations of breakpoints and the second involving identification of small regions of about 200 bases or fewer with greater caution. Both indicate the complexity of HIV-1 recombination. The resolution would depend critically on development of a recombination analysis algorithm, accumulation of HIV-1 stains, and a higher sequencing quality. With the changes in recombination pattern, phylogenetic relationships of some CRFs may also change. All these results may be critical to understand the role of recombination in a complex and dynamic HIV evolution.",

      "In this population, which included a high percentage of patients with luminal cancers, pCR did not predict for improved OS. Postneoadjuvant chemotherapy showed no discernible benefit even in subgroups with aggressive tumor biology or significant remaining tumor burden. The use of such treatment should therefore be discouraged outside of clinical trials.",

      "In this study, we find that simple and complex ASEs undergo opposite selection pressure for protein reading frame preservation, with CSEs in-between. Simple ASEs have much higher FRFPs than complex ones. We further find that the FRFPs of complex ASEs coupled with flanking exons are close to those of simple ASEs, indicating that neighboring exons of an ASE may evolve in a coordinated way to avoid protein dysfunction. Therefore, we suggest that evolutionary analyses of AS should take into consideration the effects of different splicing patterns and the joint effects of multiple AS events.",
      "Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that HDGF was expressed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. High nuclear expression of HDGF was positively correlated with FIGO stage (P = 0.032), but not associated with other clinical features, such as histological grading or lymph node status. Patients with high expression of HDGF had poorer overall survival rates than those with low expression of HDGF (P = 0.001). However, multivariate analyses showed that high nuclear expression of HDGF protein was not an independent predictor of prognosis for EC patients (P = 0.111). Our results suggest that high nuclear expression of HDGF is a potential unfavorable factor for the progression and prognosis of EC.",
      "The results of our large, single-center, retrospective study suggest that the findings of a FDG-PET scan may be interesting in the initial assessment of patients with ECD, but its greater contribution is in followup of these patients.",

      "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading known genetic cause of autism spectrum disorders. Individuals with FXS show symptoms of auditory hypersensitivity. These symptoms may arise due to sustained neural responses to repeated sounds, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. For the first time, this study shows deficits in habituation of neural responses to repeated sounds in the Fmr1 KO mice as seen in humans with FXS. We also report an abnormally high level of matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) in the auditory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice and that deletion of Mmp-9 from Fmr1 KO mice reverses habituation deficits. These data provide a translation relevant electrophysiological biomarker for sensory deficits in FXS and implicate MMP-9 as a target for drug discovery.",

In addition, the treatment also improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity of obese rats. These results strongly support S 23521 as a putative molecule for the treatment of obesity.",
      "Our study demonstrates that the age at first exposure to T. gondii is an important factor in shaping distinct behavioral and neurobiological abnormalities. Elevation in GLUN2 autoantibodies or complement protein C1q may be a potential underlying mechanism. A better understanding of these age-related differences may lead to more efficient treatments of behavioral disorders associated with T. gondii infection.",

      "These findings indicate that NGAL reduces apoptosis by regulating the four apoptosis factors Bcl-2, Bax, Fas and FasL through its two receptors 24p3R and megalin. These results also suggest that ectopic expression of NGAL in renal cells might provide a therapeutic strategy in ischemia-reperfusion by reducing apoptosis and promoting renal cell proliferation.",
      "Increased BMI is associated with increased diurnal strains in articular cartilage of both the medial and lateral compartments of the knee.

      "Similar urinary flows and osmolalities are associated with levels of plasma vasopressin and renal PGE2, which are higher in males than in females. Oxytocin does not seem to play a role in the diurnal urine formation, whereas prostaglandin E2 could represent a mediator of the gender difference, not only as a mediator of the vasopressin response, but also as an independent factor. These findings need further elucidation.",

      "Laser Doppler flowmetry detected circulatory abnormalities in primary open-angle glaucoma suspects who did not have any manifest visual field defect. Decreases in flow in glaucoma suspects were similar in magnitude to those of subjects with primary open-angle glaucoma. These data suggest that impaired optic nerve blood flow develops early in the glaucomatous process and does not develop solely as a result of glaucoma damage."
