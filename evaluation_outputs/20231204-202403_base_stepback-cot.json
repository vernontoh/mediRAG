    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, soluble ( Pro ) Renin Receptor is a predictor of gestational diabetes mellitus. According to the provided context, it has been shown that the circulating Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) is activated during normal pregnancy, but little is known about RAS in pregnancies complicated by gestational diabetes (GDM). GDM is considered not merely a temporary condition, but a harbinger of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. The aim of the study was to evaluate the circulating RAS profile in normotensive women with GDM at the third trimester of pregnancy and to compare the results with healthy pregnant and non-pregnant age-matched women. The study found that soluble ( Pro ) Renin Receptor is a predictor of GDM.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, obvious emphysema on computed tomography during an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) predicts a poor prognosis. This is based on a study that aimed to study the relationship between prognosis and emphysematous changes on CT during an AECOPD. The study found that emphysematous change was quantified by measuring the percentage of low-attenuation areas (LAA%) in the entire lung on CT images with a threshold of -950 Hounsfield units. Other factors that could influence AECOPD prognosis were also recorded on admission and analysed. At follow-ups conducted in 1 year, patient survival, the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnoea Scale, and performance status (PS) were evaluated, and a COPD Assessment Test (CAT) was completed. The study found that patients with obvious emphysema on CT during an AECOPD had a poor prognosis, as measured by the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnoea Scale and performance status (PS).",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, chemokine expression patterns in the systemic and genital tract compartments are associated with HIV-1 infection in women from Benin.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe first document in the context provides information about a study that compared levels of genital mucosal and blood chemokines between HIV-1-uninfected and HIV-1-infected female commercial sex workers (CSWs) as well as HIV-1-uninfected non-CSW control women at low risk for exposure, recruited in Cotonou, Benin. The study found that levels of certain chemokines were different between the two groups.\n\nThe second document in the context provides information about a study that compared cytokine/chemokine concentrations and the percent of tissue staining positive for T cells between non-shedding and shedding visits across all women and within a subgroup of women who intermittently shed HIV-1. The study found that certain chemokines were different between the two groups.\n\nThe third document in the context provides information about a study that assessed chemokines in breastmilk and infant HIV-1 infection risk in an observational, longitudinal cohort study. The study found that certain chemokines were different between HIV-1-infected women and non-infected women, and that these differences",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the pathological observation of lung injury in experimental animals induced by non-ferrous metal ( tin ) dust was conducted in the study. The study found that on the 30th day after exposure to tin dusts, the scattered hoar tip size of the spots in surface and section of the lungs were observed, the scattered focal granulomatous inflammation around the small bronchi and dust particles in lung tissue were observed under microscope. On the 90th day after exposure to tin dusts, the granulomatous inflammation increase, the fibroblasts proliferation, collagen fibers formation and positive VG staining were found. These pathological changes were basically the characters of specific pathological changes in early tin pneumoconiosis.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, DNA methylation of the retinoid acid receptor beta, cellular retinol-binding protein 1, and tazarotene-induced gene 1 genes was detected in gastric carcinoma (GC) samples and was associated with low mRNA expression of the respective gene. In 7 of 8 GC cell lines, the CRBP1 gene was hypermethylated, and CRBP1 transcription was inactive. In 6 of 8 GC cell lines, the TIG1 gene was hypermethylated, and TIG1 transcription was inactive. Treatment with demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restored both CRBP1 and TIG1 transcription. DNA methylation of each gene was associated significantly with low mRNA expression of the respective gene. Twenty-four of 42 GC samples (57%) demonstrated hypermethylation of at least 1 of the 3 genes. However, no significant, concordant hypermethylation of these genes was observed.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The provided context does not mention anything about antiangiogenic therapy of cerebral melanoma metastases or sustained tumor progression via vessel co-option. The context discusses the potential role of the brain environment on tumor progression and drug resistance, the need for \"brain-specific\" therapies, and the PI3K-AKT survival pathway in brain metastases. It also mentions the use of buparlisib as an antitumor agent for melanoma brain metastases and the role of plasminogen in the ability of human melanoma cells to cross a human blood-brain barrier model. However, it does not provide any information about antiangiogenic therapy or vessel co-option in cerebral melanoma metastases.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, clove and eugenol in noncytotoxic concentrations exert immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory action on cytokine production by murine macrophages. Clove (100\u00b5g/well) inhibited IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-10 production and exerted an efficient action either before or after LPS challenge for all cytokines. Eugenol did not affect IL-1\u03b2 production but inhibited IL-6 and IL-10 production. The action of eugenol (50 or 100\u00b5g/well) on IL-6 production prevented efficiently effects of LPS either before or after its addition, whereas on IL-10 production it counteracted significantly LPS action when added after LPS incubation.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, pretreatment with stellate ganglion blockade before ischemia does not reduce infarct size in rat hearts. The study found no significant difference in infarct size between the preconditioned (P) group and the control group.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, lipidomics revealed multiple pathway effects of a multi-components preparation on lipid biochemistry in ApoE*3Leiden.CETP mice. The preparation SUB885C caused significant reductions in plasma cholesterol, CETP levels, CETP activity, and increased HDL-C. It influenced lipidomics classes of cholesterol esters and triglycerides the most. In vitro, SUB885C extract caused adipolysis stimulation and adipogenesis inhibition in 3T3-L1 cells.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The provided context does not mention any correlation between elevated nm23 protein expression and diminished progression-free survival in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, the provided context does not mention anything about leukotriene B ( 4 ) enhancing tumour necrosis factor-alpha-induced CCL27 production in human keratinocytes.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Hemoglobin levels may affect the tumor response in men with localized prostate adenocarcinoma (LPA) treated with neoadjuvant androgen-suppression therapy (NAST) and external-beam radiotherapy. However, the association between hemoglobin levels and biochemical outcome for localized prostate cancer treated with neoadjuvant androgen-suppression therapy and external-beam radiotherapy is not clear. Further research is needed to determine the impact of hemoglobin levels on the tumor response and biochemical outcome for localized prostate cancer treated with neoadjuvant androgen-suppression therapy and external-beam radiotherapy.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study suggests that non-esterified fatty acids do not impair insulin-mediated glucose uptake and disposition in the liver. The study found that whole-body glucose disposal was inversely associated with fatty liver, and that NEFA suppression during the OGTT was decreased in individuals with severe fatty liver. However, the study did not find any association between the amount of visceral fat and the degree of fatty liver. Additionally, the study did not find any association between non-esterified fatty acids and whole-body glucose production and disposal measurements.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, induction of oral tolerance to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) can ameliorate atherosclerosis. Oral tolerance to oxLDL resulted in a significant attenuation of the initiation and progression of atherogenesis in LDL receptor-/- mice fed a Western-type diet. Tolerance to oxLDL induced a significant increase in CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ cells in spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes, and these cells specifically responded to oxLDL with increased transforming growth factor-beta production. Tolerance to oxLDL also increased the mRNA expression of Foxp3, CTLA-4, and CD25 in the plaque. In contrast, tolerance to malondialdehyde-treated LDL (MDA-LDL) did not affect atherogenesis.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the study found that women with type 1 diabetes and insulin resistance have a more atherogenic lipoprotein subfraction cholesterol distribution.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, almost 20% of angle procedures in pediatric glaucoma eventually fail, and surgeons are confronted with a choice of what procedure to do next: a trabeculectomy with or without adjunctive antifibrosis therapy, glaucoma drainage surgery, or cyclodestructive procedures.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the present study tested the hypothesis that rosuvastatin treatment may attenuate left ventricular (LV) remodelling and dysfunction in the failing heart, which may be associated with alterations of Ca(2+)-regulatory protein. The study found that rosuvastatin prevented the decrease of SERCA2a and pSer16-PLB expression, increased SERCA activity, but showed no effect on PLB expression. Furthermore, rosuvastatin reduced the increased IL-6 level and further elevated IL-10 level in the peri-infarct and remote zones of MI.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, prolonged resuscitation of metabolic acidosis after trauma is associated with more complications. Morbidly obese patients with persistent metabolic acidosis developed MOF at a significantly greater rate than did normal weight patients with or without persistent metabolic acidosis. The duration of metabolic crisis was longer in those patients with unfavorable (GOSe \u2264 6) versus favorable (GOSe \u2265 7) outcome at 6 months. In four multivariate models, the burden of metabolic crisis was a powerful independent predictor of poor outcome.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, NSC23925 has been shown to prevent the development of multidrug resistance in osteosarcoma cells in vitro. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of NSC23925 on the prevention of multidrug resistance in ovarian cancer, especially in vivo.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, restoration of klotho expression induces apoptosis and autophagy in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, leukocytosis is proportional to HELLP syndrome severity. This is evident from the regression analysis which showed that platelet counts varied inversely with WBC counts. Patients with class I HELLP syndrome had significantly higher WBC counts than patients with other classes of HELLP syndrome. Additionally, circulating TSP-1 levels were significantly lower in HELLP syndrome compared to all other study groups, while they were unaltered in preeclampsia compared to the control groups. There was a significant positive linear correlation between TSP-1 levels and platelet count in HELLP syndrome. This suggests that HELLP syndrome is an inflammatory form of preeclampsia.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the study found that high DcR3 expression was associated with high-grade and high-stage RCCs, and the incidence of distant metastasis and lymph node metastasis was significantly higher in the group with high DcR3 expression. DcR3 expression correlated negatively with disease-specific survival and progression-free survival in univariate analyses. A multivariate Cox regression analysis retained DcR3 expression as an independent prognostic factor that outperformed the Karnofsky performance status. In patients with high-stage RCCs expressing DcR3, the 2-year survival probability was 25%, whereas in patients with DcR3-negative tumors, the survival probability was 65% (P <.001). Moreover, DcR3 serum levels were significantly higher in patients with high-stage localized disease (P =.007) and metastatic disease (P =.001).",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, a Multi-Component Prime-Boost Vaccination Regimen with a Consensus MOMP Antigen enhances Chlamydia trachomatis Clearance. The DNA-HuAd5-MVA-Protein vaccine regimen induced a cellular response with a Th1-biased serum antibody response, alongside high serum and vaginal MOMP-specific antibodies. This regimen significantly enhanced clearance against intravaginal C. trachomatis serovar D infection in both BALB/c and B6C3F1 mouse strains. This enhanced clearance was shown to be CD4(+) T-cell dependent.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The role of angiotensin II type 2 (AT(2)) receptor stimulation in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance is still unclear. Therefore, it is not clear if the angiotensin II type 2 receptor agonist Compound 21 (C21) is protective in experimental diabetes-associated atherosclerosis.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, fitness and adiposity are independently associated with cardiometabolic risk in youth.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe provided context indicates that the study examined the independent associations of muscle fitness and cardiorespiratory fitness with clustered metabolic risk in youth. The study found that both muscle fitness and cardiorespiratory fitness were independently associated with clustered metabolic risk in youth.\n\nAdditionally, the background context mentions that the study aimed to explore whether socio-economic differences exist in cardiometabolic risk markers in children and whether lifestyle-related factors potentially mediate these differences. However, the provided context does not mention any association between fitness and adiposity in youth. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer on whether fitness and adiposity are independently associated with cardiometabolic risk in youth based solely on the provided context.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, patient-prosthesis mismatch in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement can affect survival. An independent detrimental effect of prosthesis-patient mismatch on survival was observed in patients with aortic stenosis/mixed disease who had preoperative left ventricular dysfunction (hazard ratio, 2.3; P =.03). However, no such effect was observed in patients with aortic insufficiency, irrespective of left ventricular function.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the study found that a high frequency of competitive sports early in life is associated with greater bone mineral density (BMD) at several bone sites, indicating that increases in BMD following physical activity (PA) are preserved longer than previously believed. The study also used quantitative ultrasound (QUS) to measure heel bone quality and quantitative computed tomography (QCT) to assess volumetric BMD, bone geometry and strength at the spine and mid-femur. However, the study did not specifically investigate the association between lifetime sport and leisure activity participation and greater bone size and strength in older men.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, hemizygous deletion of CTGF/CCN2 does not suffice to prevent fibrosis of the severely injured kidney. The study examined the effects of CCN2 haploinsufficiency on the progression of renal scarring in long-term STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy, in a more advanced stage of obstructive nephropathy following unilateral ureteric obstruction (UUO), and in severe aristolochic acid (AA)-induced tubulotoxic nephritis. The results showed that CCN2 haploinsufficiency did not prevent fibrosis of the severely injured kidney.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, severity of hepatic encephalopathy before orthotopic liver transplantation correlated with quality of life.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, sutureless securement device, StatLock, has been shown to reduce catheter-related complications when compared to tape in earlier studies. In this study, 170 patients requiring PICCs were randomized to suture or StatLock securement and followed throughout their entire catheter course. PICC-related complications including dislodgment, infection, occlusion, leakage, and central venous thrombosis were documented and catheter outcome data were compared. The results showed that statistically significant differences existed between the suture and StatLock groups, with the StatLock group having a lower incidence of catheter-related complications.\n\nIn addition, sutureless anastomosis has been demonstrated to have better hemodynamics at the venous outflow with a supposed reduction of venous neointimal hyperplasia (VNH), which is responsible for outflow stenosis and access thrombosis. This may potentially improve graft patency in new self-sealing prosthetic grafts.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, attachment to laminin-111 facilitates transforming growth factor beta-induced expression of matrix metalloproteinase-3 in synovial fibroblasts.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, functional health literacy is associated with health status and health-related knowledge in people living with HIV-AIDS. A study conducted on a community-recruited sample of 339 HIV-infected men and women found that patients with inadequate health literacy had lower CD4 cell counts, higher viral loads, were less likely to be taking antiretroviral medications, reported a greater number of hospitalizations, and reported poorer health than those with marginal or adequate health literacy. In addition, after adjusting for years of formal education, lower health literacy was associated with poorer knowledge of one's HIV-related health status, poorer AIDS-related disease and treatment knowledge, and more negative health care perceptions and experiences.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the context indicates that a technique where an Alfieri stitch is placed in the mitral valve through the aortotomy while performing septal myectomy for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy is used.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, computer-assisted instruction (CAI) tutorial program can improve clinical reasoning skills of dietetics students. The study compared the effects of a CAI tutorial program on learning clinical reasoning skills in undergraduate dietetics students and found that scores on the simulation test were significantly higher in the CAI group compared to the control group. The study also found that mastery of objectives related to lower- and higher-level clinical reasoning skills introduced in the tutorial program was computed.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, soy protein isolates of varied isoflavone content can influence serum thyroid hormones in healthy young men. The study found that high-isoflavone soy protein isolate (61.7 +/- 7.4 mg iso/day) supplementation led to a significant decrease in total triiodothyronine (T3) and free T3 levels, while low-isoflavone soy protein isolate (1.64 +/- 0.19 mg iso/day) supplementation led to a significant increase in total thyroxine (T4) levels. Milk protein isolate (MPI) supplementation had no significant effect on any of the thyroid hormones.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, immunity to blood stages of Plasmodium falciparum is dependent on a specific pattern of immunoglobulin subclass responses to multiple blood stage antigens.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The current study was based on multiple recombination analysis, which may have produced more impartial results. The analysis of a representative set of HIV type 1 (HIV-1) subtype B pol sequences from 5700 patients enrolled in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study suggests that recombination pattern reanalysis of some HIV-1 circulating recombination forms may suggest the necessity and difficulty of revision. The analysis based on the predicted networks suggests that significantly stronger recombination signals were observed for the inferred ancestors of the X4 strains, recombination events between different lineages and recombination events between putative reservoir virus and those from a later population, an early star-like topology observed for four of the patients who died of AIDS, and a significantly higher number of recombinants were predicted at sampling points that corresponded to peaks in the viral load levels.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, osteopontin enhances endogenous repair after neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. The study identified osteopontin as the most highly upregulated factor early after HI and explored its role in brain damage and repair.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, xenon pretreatment attenuates anesthetic-induced apoptosis in the developing brain in comparison with nitrous oxide and hypoxia.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, p130 plays a role in TGF-beta-induced cell-cycle arrest in Rb mutant HT-3 cells. The study found that TGF-beta markedly enhanced the binding of p21 with cdk2 but decreased that of cdk2 with cyclin E and inhibited the phosphorylation of p130. Additionally, E2F-1 protein level was lower in TGF-beta-treated cells, which might be the result of enhanced binding between E2F-4 and p130.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, past cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3, obesity, and earlier menopause are associated with an increased risk of vulval cancer in postmenopausal women.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, severity of coronary artery disease is not correlated to cerebrovascular reactivity. However, degree of coronary stenosis is correlated to cerebrovascular reactivity.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The objective of this study was to examine the association of family-centered rounds with family experiences and health services use. However, the provided context does not contain enough information to determine if there is a correlation between family experiences and pediatric health services use associated with family-centered rounds.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, high doses of EDU were not toxic to willow and did not act as nitrogen fertilizer. The study found that all EDU was transferred to the leaves and high doses of EDU increased the leaf N content. However, EDU did not affect the C content and distribution within the plant body. Additionally, the study found that EDU was not toxic to the willow and there was no EDU persistence in the soil.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, high maternal body mass index increases the risk of neonatal early onset group B streptococcal disease. In obese parturients with BMI > 30, there was an 80% increased risk for verified neonatal EOGBS disease (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.0). When cases with clinical sepsis were included a significant risk increment was also found in overweight women with BMI 25.0-29.9 (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.0).",
    "\n\nAnswer: The provided context does not mention anything about caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) decreasing acute pneumonitis after irradiation in vitro and in vivo. However, it does mention that CAPE induces apoptosis and increases radiosensitivity in lung cancer, and that it could be a useful adjuvant agent for lung cancer treatment. Additionally, it mentions that CAPE was reported capable of depleting glutathione (GSH) and that its radiosensitizing effect and toxicity were examined.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study did not find any significant difference in early myocardial hypertrophy assessed by morphometric studies between the standard group (treated without thymoglobulin), the ATG group (received thymoglobulin electively), and the standard+ATG group (administered thymoglobulin upon a drop in renal function).",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, dNA-PKcs expression was found to be a predictor of biochemical recurrence after permanent Iodine 125 interstitial brachytherapy for prostate cancer. In the study, positive DNA-PKcs nuclear staining was closely associated with biochemical recurrence (P=.003). On multivariate analysis, only the Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen level, and DNA-PKcs status remained predictive of recurrence (P=.003, P=.002, and P=.01, respectively).",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, chemotherapy for cancer causes apoptosis that precedes hypoplasia in crypts of the small intestine in humans. According to the provided documents, apoptosis increased sevenfold in intestinal crypts at one day after chemotherapy, and villus area, crypt length, mitotic count per crypt, and enterocyte height decreased at three days after chemotherapy. Disaccharidase activities remained unchanged. Electron microscopy showed increased open tight junctions of enterocytes at day 3, consistent with more immature cells. All indices improved by 16 days.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, alveolar macrophage gene expression is altered in the setting of alcohol use disorders. The study found that whole genome microarray analysis of alveolar macrophages obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage from a test cohort of subjects with AUDs (n = 7), and controls (n = 7) who were pair-matched on age, gender, and smoking, revealed differentially expressed candidate genes based on alcohol consumption. Additionally, alveolar macrophage mRNA samples from a second cohort of subjects with AUDs (n = 7) and controls (n = 7) were used to confirm gene expression differences related to AUDs.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, a diminished postnatal surge of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants is not additional evidence for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The study found that the number of Ad spermatogonia in unilateral cryptorchid testes correlated in a nonlinear fashion with those in the contralateral scrotal testes, indicating that the development of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants is not completely absent. Additionally, the total number of germ cells in the cryptorchid testes in the first six months of life is normal, after which time it declines rapidly. This suggests that the development of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants is not completely impaired. Therefore, a diminished postnatal surge of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants is not additional evidence for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, female children were nearly three times more likely to be stunted than male children. Households that were food insecure with hunger were also three times more likely than other households to have a stunted child.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, combination therapy with VELCADE and tissue plasminogen activator is neuroprotective in aged rats after stroke and targets microRNA-146a and the toll-like receptor signaling pathway. The study found that combination treatment with VELCADE and tPA reduced infarct volume compared with respective monotherapies. The study also found that the combination treatment increased miR-l46a levels, which was inversely associated with the reduction of vascular interleukin-1 receptor-activated kinases 1 immunoreactivity. In vitro, fibrin upregulated interleukin-1 receptor-activated kinases 1 and TLR4 expression and downregulated miR-146a on primary human cerebral endothelial cells. VELCADE elevated miR-146 levels and abolished fibrin-increased interleukin-1 receptor activated kinases 1 proteins.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, higher peak weight velocity (PWV) in infancy was associated with a significant increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in children at 10 years. For each 10.2\\u200acm/year [2 standard deviation (SD)] increase in PWV, SBP increased by 2.94 mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.34, 4.54] after adjustment for potential confounders including birth weight and body mass index. A 5.1\\u200akg/year (2 SD) higher PWV was associated with a 2.13 mmHg (95% CI 0.51, 3.74) increase in SBP and a 1.91 mmHg (95% CI 0.52, 3.30) increase in DBP. No consistent associations were found between PWV and the Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) index after multiple adjustments.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, the provided context does not mention anything about the hepato-protective effects of garlic-derived S-allylmercaptocysteine in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in vivo animal model.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the study found that an increasing proportion of time spent performing chest compressions during cardiac arrest was associated with a higher likelihood of survival to hospital discharge in patients with out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. The odds ratios of surviving to hospital discharge in the 2 highest categories of chest compression fraction compared with the reference category were 3.01 and 2.33.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, expression of snail in pancreatic cancer promotes metastasis and chemoresistance. In the study, it was found that snail expression was closely correlated with lymph node invasion and distant metastasis in pancreatic cancer. After transfecting snail cDNA into pancreatic cancer cell line Panc-1, it was found that snail triggered overt epithelial to mesenchymal transitions in Panc-1 cells, which promoted the invasive ability of the cells in vitro. Moreover, snail-transfected Panc-1 cells produced more spontaneous metastasis than parental untransfected cells after orthotopically injected into the pancreas of nude mice. Additionally, overexpression of snail enhanced the chemoresistance to 5-fluorouracil of gemcitabine at different dosages.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, slug down-regulation by RNA interference inhibits invasion growth in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The study utilized RNA interference to knockdown Slug gene expression in ESCC cells and evaluated the effect on survival and invasive carcinoma using a Boyden chamber transwell assay in vitro. The results showed that knockdown of Slug significantly inhibited ESCC cell invasion and metastasis.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, postoperative CMF does not ameliorate poor outcomes in women with residual invasive breast cancer after neoadjuvant epirubicin/docetaxel chemotherapy.\n\nExplanation: The study included 377 patients with breast cancer who received preoperative chemotherapy, and 191 women were included in the final analysis. The major outcome parameters were event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). The study tested various parameters for their prognostic role, including postneoadjuvant chemotherapy, patient age, breast cancer subtype, histological grade, pCR, residual lymph node invasion, and residual invasive tumor size. The study did not find that postoperative CMF ameliorated poor outcomes in women with residual invasive breast cancer after neoadjuvant epirubicin/docetaxel chemotherapy.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The WD40 domain is required for LRRK2 neurotoxicity. Removing the WD40 domain prevents complex formation and autophosphorylation, and completely blocks the neurotoxicity of multiple LRRK2 PD mutations.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the hypothesis that inhibition of leukocyte function by administration of monoclonal antibody 60.3 (MoAb 60.3) improves electrophysiological recovery and decreases injury volume following transient focal cerebral ischemia in cats was tested and found to be true.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, prenatal lipopolysaccharide exposure can affect maternal behavior and male offspring sexual behavior in adulthood. In the study, the LPS-treated dams presented reduced maternal behavior, decreased general activity, a smaller body weight difference between GD21 and PND1, a greater number of perinatal deaths, and smaller litters. For the male pups, LPS treatment resulted in a decreased body weight on PND2, whereas the anogenital distance and the day of testis descent were not modified. The male sexual behavior was impaired by prenatal LPS. Particularly the number of ejaculating animals was reduced. The testis weight was also lower in the prenatally LPS-treated rats than in the control rats.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (AFABP) levels are significantly elevated in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and correlate with indices of adiposity, inflammation, and fibrosis. AFABP also correlates with subcutaneous fat rather than visceral fat.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the study found that people with mild-moderate Alzheimer's disease have greater variability of gait at initiation compared to controls.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, as a pitcher approached muscular fatigue during the final 2 innings of a simulated baseball game, there was a significant decrease in ball velocity, and the trunk was significantly closer to a vertical position.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the bisphosphonate Pamidronate has been shown to be an intestinal antiinflammatory agent in rat and mouse experimental colitis. In a study, Pamidronate was tested along with other bisphosphonates, alendronate, and ibandronate, in the trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid and dextran sulfate sodium models of rat colitis and the adoptive lymphocyte transfer model of colitis in mice. Pamidronate was found to improve chemically induced trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid and dextran sulfate sodium colitis in rats and extend this beneficial effect to lymphocyte transfer colitis. In vitro, Pamidronate has no effect on intestinal epithelial cells in terms of cytokine/chemokine release, but enhances IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, and IL-10 production by T cells in coculture. Pamidronate also exerts a direct immunomodulatory effect on T cells, favoring Th1 differentiation and impairing Th17 polarization. Another study found that Pamidronate has antiinflammatory effects at the cardiovascular level because of inhibition of prenylation, which also probably underlies its therapeutic effects in",
    "\n\nAnswer: The provided context does not mention any study or research that specifically examines the effect of bilateral cochlear implant experience on sound localization acuity in children. However, it does mention a study that characterizes horizontal plane sound localization in interfering noise at different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and compares performance across normal-hearing listeners and users of unilateral and bilateral cochlear implants (CIs). The study found that sound localization is a measure of binaural processing and is thus well suited to assessing the benefit of bilateral implantation. The results will inform clinicians and implant manufacturers how to focus their efforts to improve localization with CIs in noisy situations.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The provided context does not mention anything about the role of GM-CSF in the healing of ecthyma gangrenosum lesions in kidney transplant recipients.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, pterygium is related to a decrease in corneal endothelial cell density. This was found in a retrospective cross-sectional study where 90 consecutive patients with unilateral primary pterygium were enrolled from January 2010 to June 2012. The relationship between the percentage of pterygium to cornea and a decrease in the ECD was analyzed. An increase in astigmatism in eyes with pterygium was evaluated for association with decreased ECD using the Pearson correlation test.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, long-term reversal of hypocholesterolaemia in patients with chronic hepatitis C is related to sustained viral response and viral genotype. Genotype-3 of HCV patients had age-adjusted hypocholesterolaemia and more frequent hepatic steatosis (P < 0.001). Steatosis was inversely correlated with serum cholesterol (P < 0.01) and directly with viral load (P < 0.03). In patients with genotype-3 of HCV and sustained viral response, serum cholesterol increased from 138 (95% CI: 120-151) to 180 mg/dL (95% CI: 171-199) 12 months after treatment conclusion (P < 0.0001). By contrast, cholesterol values were unchanged in genotype-3 of HCV non-responders and in patients with genotype-1 of HCV regardless of response. Rising cholesterol in sustained viral response did not parallel the changes in beta-hydroxybutyrate.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study did not specifically investigate the association between life style interventions and decreased levels of cathepsins L and S in plasma in moderately overweight individuals. However, the study did find that higher levels of cathepsin S were associated with higher levels of CRP and IL-6 in a community-based sample, with similar associations observed in normal-weight participants. The study suggests that cathepsin S may play a role in the development of atherosclerosis and inflammation, and further research is needed to better understand the mechanisms underlying this association.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, the provided context does not mention any association between a novel polymorphism of the CYP19 gene and essential hypertension in China. The context discusses the association between the -344C/T polymorphism in the CYP11B2 gene and hypertension in the Chinese population, but does not mention any other gene polymorphisms.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, different alternative splicing patterns - simple and complex ASEs - may be subject to opposite selection forces for protein reading frame preservation. Simple ASEs have higher FRFPs than CSEs, while complex ASEs have lower FRFPs than CSEs. Conservation of the ASE/CSE splicing pattern increases the FRFPs of simple ASEs but decreases those of complex ASEs. Contrary to the well-recognized concept of strong selection pressure on conserved ASEs for protein reading frame preservation, our results show that conserved complex ASEs are relaxed from such pressure and the frame-disrupting effect caused by the insertion of complex ASEs can be offset by compensatory changes in their flanking exons.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, high nuclear expression of HDGF correlates with disease progression and poor prognosis in human endometrial carcinoma. The study found that patients with increased HDGF expression levels had poorer overall survival rates than those with low expression of HDGF levels (P=0.006). Multivariate analysis revealed that high expression of nuclear HDGF was an independent prognostic indicator of patient survival.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The provided context does not provide enough information to definitively answer this question. However, it does mention that 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scanning was used in both the initial assessment and follow-up of patients with Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD). In the initial assessment, the study aimed to assess the value of whole-body scanning with FDG-PET in a large cohort of ECD patients. In the follow-up, the study used FDG-PET scanning to detect clinical changes in presymptomatic (preHD) subjects carrying the HD mutation, and to predict age at onset using multiple regression analysis including subject's age, CAG mutation size and glucose uptake as variables. Additionally, the study used FDG-PET scanning in combination with MRI and clinical evaluation to assess patients with FTD due to GRN mutations. Therefore, it can be concluded that 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scanning can be useful in both the initial assessment and follow-up of patients with Erdheim-Chester disease, but more information is needed to determine if it is more useful in one aspect over the other.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the protein levels of UCP2 were significantly higher in tumor tissues of the human head and neck, skin, prostate, and pancreatic tumor samples examined than that in the adjacent normal tissues.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, matrix metalloproteinase-9 deletion reverses auditory evoked potential habituation deficit in a mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, air quality influences the prevalence of hay fever and sinusitis. The study found a statistically significant relationship between air quality and the prevalence of hay fever and sinusitis. The standardized regression coefficient for hay fever was 0.0120 to 0.016 and for sinusitis was 0.013 to 0.027. The study also found that higher pollutant concentrations predicted a higher prevalence for the disease condition.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, S 23521 decreased food intake and body weight gain in diet-induced obese rats. The subcutaneous treatment at high dose significantly reduced cumulative energy intake, body weight gain, adiposity, and plasma triglyceride levels. Additionally, the treatment improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity of obese rats.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, anti-NMDA receptor autoantibodies and associated neurobehavioral pathology in mice are dependent on age of first exposure to Toxoplasma gondii. Juvenile-infected mice exhibited decreased pre-pulse inhibition of the acoustic startle (PPI) and greater elevation of GLUN2 autoantibodies compared to adult-infected mice. In addition, age-dependent differences were found in regional expression of NMDAR subunits and markers of glutamatergic, GABAergic, and monoaminergic systems. These findings suggest that the age during first exposure to T. gondii may affect the development of neurobehavioral pathology and the immune response in mice.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, risedronate gastrointestinal absorption is not independent of site and rate of administration. In study A, no statistically significant site-specific differences in any pharmacokinetic parameter were observed. Based on the area under the serum concentration-time profile and the amount of drug excreted in the urine unchanged, the extent of risedronate absorption did not differ significantly following a rapid or a slow infusion in study B.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study aims to elucidate the role of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) in regulating apoptosis of tubular epithelial cells in a hypoxia-reperfusion model. However, the study does not provide any information on whether NGAL protects renal tubular epithelial cells in hypoxia-reperfusion by reducing apoptosis.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, high body mass index (BMI) is associated with increased diurnal strains in the articular cartilage of the knee. Subjects with high BMI had significantly thicker cartilage on both the patella and femoral groove, as compared to subjects with normal BMI. Diurnal cartilage strains were dependent on location in the knee joint, as well as BMI. Subjects with high BMI, compared to those with normal BMI, exhibited significantly higher compressive strains in the tibial cartilage. However, there was no significant effect of BMI on diurnal cartilage strain in the femur.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The present study investigated the biochemical mechanisms of electroacupuncture (EA) anti-inflammation in a rat model. In Experiment 1, plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels were measured to see if EA regulates CORT secretion. The results showed that EA treatment significantly decreased plasma CORT levels compared to the sham acupuncture group. In Experiment 2, the effects of the adrenal gland on the therapeutic actions of EA were studied using adrenalectomy (ADX) rats. The results showed that EA treatment still had anti-edema effects in ADX rats, indicating that the adrenal gland does not mediate the anti-edema effects of EA. In Experiment 3, a prototypical glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, RU486, was used to determine whether it affects EA anti-edema. The results showed that RU486 did not affect the anti-edema effects of EA. Therefore, the present study suggests that corticosterone does not mediate electroacupuncture-produced anti-edema in a rat model of inflammation.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, soluble oncoprotein 185HER-2 in pleural fluid has limited usefulness for the diagnostic evaluation of malignant effusions. The sensitivity of sp185(HER-2) alone is only 7%, and the combination of sp185(HER-2) with CEA and CA 15-3 only increases sensitivity by 5%. Additionally, only 1 patient with breast adenocarcinoma among 45 cytology-negative malignant effusions had sp185(HER-2) above the diagnostic cutoff point.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, there is no evidence to suggest that bevacizumab is superior to Temozolomide in causing mitochondrial dysfunction in human brain tumors. The study only investigated the direct effects of Temozolomide and Bevacizumab on mitochondria isolated from human brain tumors, and did not compare the effects of these drugs on mitochondria in brain tumors. Additionally, the study did not investigate the neurotoxic condition (calcium overload) in relation to mitochondrial dysfunction. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if bevacizumab is superior to Temozolomide in causing mitochondrial dysfunction in human brain tumors based on the information provided.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, urinary concentration does not exclusively rely on plasma vasopressin. A study found no difference in urine osmolality and aquaporin-2 excretion between genders. Additionally, there was no correlation between urinary concentration and plasma vasopressin. However, there was a trend towards a higher reabsorption of free water in males, which could potentially affect urinary concentration.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, plasma levels of angiostatin and endostatin are elevated for 2-4 weeks after colorectal cancer surgery.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, adherence to the 2006 American Heart Association Diet and Lifestyle Recommendations for cardiovascular disease risk reduction is not associated with bone health in older Puerto Ricans. In a cross-sectional study of 933 Puerto Ricans aged 47-79 y, bone mineral density (BMD) at the femoral neck, trochanter, total hip, and lumbar spine (L2-L4) was measured by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The study tested the hypothesis that adherence to the AHA-DLR is associated with bone health. However, the results showed no significant association between adherence to the AHA-DLR and bone health in older Puerto Ricans.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, basophils are recruited to inflamed lungs in mice and humans. Adoptive transfer of basophils to OVA-sensitized hosts enhanced lung IL-4 and IL-13 release while co-administration of OVA further aggravated airway inflammation and Th2 responses in LNs. Human basophils augmented in vitro IL-4 expression in effector memory CD4 T cells that include CRTH2(+)  cells through IL-4 and TCR-independent pathways. However, the impact of basophils on the function of tissue CD4 effector T cells remains unknown.",

    "\n\nAnswer: No, nT-ProBNP does not predict rhythm stability after cardioversion of lone atrial fibrillation.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No indication of impairment to the haematological indices measured, hepatic function, or muscle damage was apparent after Cr supplementation. In contrast to previous reports, no detrimental effects of creatine supplementation on the renal function indices were observed in two-thirds nephrectomized or sham-operated animals. No differences were observed in inulin (0.28+/-0.08 vs 0.25+/-0.08 ml/min/100 g; P=NS) or creatinine clearance rates. Serum cystatin C concentration, urinary protein excretion, and albumin and urea clearance were comparable between creatine-supplemented and control-diet fed animals in both sham-operated and two-thirds nephrectomized animals. Serum creatine and intramuscular total creatine concentrations were higher in creatine-supplemented groups (P<0.05).",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the cAMP effectors Epac and PKA are involved in the hepatic cystogenesis of an animal model of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease ( ARPKD ). The hypothesis is that elevated cAMP stimulates cholangiocyte proliferation via these two downstream effectors, and that intracellular calcium is also involved in this process. Assessment of Epac isoforms and PKA regulatory subunits at the messenger RNA and protein level showed that both normal and PCK cholangiocytes increase their growth upon Epac-specific stimulation, while PKA-specific stimulation results in differential effects, suppressing proliferation in normal cholangiocytes but accelerating this process in PCK cholangiocytes. Pharmacological inhibitors and small interfering RNA-mediated gene silencing demonstrated the specificity of each effector activation, as well as the involvement of MEK-ERK1/2 signaling in all the observed effector-associated proliferation changes.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, chronic administration of atypical antipsychotics, specifically risperidone and clozapine, improves behavioral and synaptic defects of STOP null mice. Long-term administration of either drug results in alleviation of behavioral alterations mimicking some negative symptoms and partial amelioration of some cognitive defects in STOP null mice. Additionally, clozapine treatment also improves synaptic plasticity of the STOP null animals by restoring long-term potentiation in the hippocampus.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study was designed to clarify whether the association between Chlamydia pneumoniae and atherosclerotic disease is based on C pneumoniae-induced transformation of a stable into an unstable atherosclerotic plaque or on stimulation of hypercoagulability leading to increased thrombotic arterial occlusions by C pneumoniae infection. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonographic monitoring of the middle cerebral artery during carotid endarterectomy offers the opportunity to study, before removal of the plaque, atherothrombotic emboli dislodging from an unstable carotid plaque (plaque-related emboli) and emboli related to (excessive) thrombus formation at the endarterectomy site after removal of the plaque and restoration of flow (thrombosis-related emboli).",

Patients with high expression of HDGF had poorer overall survival rates than those with low expression of HDGF (P = 0.001). However, multivariate analyses showed that high nuclear expression of HDGF protein was not an independent predictor of prognosis for EC patients (P = 0.111). Our results suggest that high nuclear expression of HDGF is a potential unfavorable factor for the progression and prognosis of EC.",
      "The results of our large, single-center, retrospective study suggest that the findings of a FDG-PET scan may be interesting in the initial assessment of patients with ECD, but its greater contribution is in followup of these patients.",
      "Over expression of UCP2 in certain tumors provides the rationale to speculate that UCP2 may promote tumor growth in these cancers.",
      "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading known genetic cause of autism spectrum disorders. Individuals with FXS show symptoms of auditory hypersensitivity. These symptoms may arise due to sustained neural responses to repeated sounds, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. For the first time, this study shows deficits in habituation of neural responses to repeated sounds in the Fmr1 KO mice as seen in humans with FXS. We also report an abnormally high level of matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) in the auditory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice and that deletion of Mmp-9 from Fmr1 KO mice reverses habituation deficits. These data provide a translation relevant electrophysiological biomarker for sensory deficits in FXS and implicate MMP-9 as a target for drug discovery.",
      "Prevalence of hay fever and sinusitis are correlated with air quality. Improvements in air quality are associated with decreased prevalence of both hay fever and sinusitis. Laryngoscope, 2009.",
      "S 23521 is an effective glucagon-like peptide-1-(7-36) amide analogue, which induced a decrease in energy intake, body weight, and adiposity in a rat model of diet-induced obesity. In addition, the treatment also improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity of obese rats. These results strongly support S 23521 as a putative molecule for the treatment of obesity.",
      "Our study demonstrates that the age at first exposure to T. gondii is an important factor in shaping distinct behavioral and neurobiological abnormalities. Elevation in GLUN2 autoantibodies or complement protein C1q may be a potential underlying mechanism. A better understanding of these age-related differences may lead to more efficient treatments of behavioral disorders associated with T. gondii infection.",
      "These studies indicate that the rate and extent of risedronate absorption are independent of the site of administration along the gastrointestinal tract, and that the extent of absorption is not affected by the rate of administration.",
      "These findings indicate that NGAL reduces apoptosis by regulating the four apoptosis factors Bcl-2, Bax, Fas and FasL through its two receptors 24p3R and megalin. These results also suggest that ectopic expression of NGAL in renal cells might provide a therapeutic strategy in ischemia-reperfusion by reducing apoptosis and promoting renal cell proliferation.",
      "Increased BMI is associated with increased diurnal strains in articular cartilage of both the medial and lateral compartments of the knee. The increased cartilage strains observed in individuals with high BMI may, in part, explain the elevated risk of OA associated with obesity or may reflect alterations in the cartilage mechanical properties in subjects with high BMI.",
      "The data demonstrate that EA activates the adrenals to increase plasma corticosterone levels and suppress edema and suggest that EA effects differ in healthy subjects and in those with pathologies.",
      "Measurement of pleural fluid sp185(HER-2) has poor diagnostic performance in patients with malignant effusions.",
      "TMZ and BEV can directly cause the dysfunction of mitochondria isolated from human brain tumors. However, BEV has a greater ability to disturb mitochondrial function in mitochondria isolated from human brain tumors than either TMZ or calcium overload conditions.",
      "Similar urinary flows and osmolalities are associated with levels of plasma vasopressin and renal PGE2, which are higher in males than in females. Oxytocin does not seem to play a role in the diurnal urine formation, whereas prostaglandin E2 could represent a mediator of the gender difference, not only as a mediator of the vasopressin response, but also as an independent factor. These findings need further elucidation.",
      "MICR has a very transient impact on plasma levels of endostatin and no impact on angiostatin during the first 21 days following surgery. Thus, angiostatin and endostatin do not likely contribute to or inhibit the persistent proangiogenic changes noted after MICR.",
      "Dietary guidelines for CVD risk reduction may also benefit bone health in this Hispanic cohort. Synchronizing dietary guidelines for these 2 common diseases may provide a simplified public health message. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01231958.",
      "Basophils may worsen Th2 inflammatory disorders through direct interactions with pathogenic CD4 T cells as well as by enhancing DC-induced Th2 cell development.",
      "We conclude that inhibition of TLR4 with eritoran in an in situ murine model significantly reduces MI/R injury and markers of an inflammatory response.",
      "HMbeta supplementation can increase survival time and promotes metabolic changes in cancer-bearing animals, but it seems to work in a time-dependent manner.",
      "The probability of a successful cardioversion correlates inversely with NT-proBNP values. The short-term success of a cardioversion might be predicted by prior determination of NT-proBNP.",
      "These data provide evidence that there are no obvious adverse effects of acute or more chronic Cr supplementation on the haematological indices measured, nor on hepatic, muscle, and renal function. Therefore there is no apparent health risk associated with Cr supplementation to healthy people when it is ingested in quantities that have been scientifically proven to increase muscle Cr stores.",
      "Our data provide strong evidence that both cAMP effectors, Epac and PKA, and the levels of intracellular calcium are involved in the hepatic cystogenesis of ARPKD.",
      "All together, the pharmacological reactivity of STOP null mice to antipsychotics evokes the pharmacological response of humans to such drugs. Totally, our study suggests that STOP null mice may provide a useful preclinical model to evaluate pharmacological properties of antipsychotic drugs.",
      "This study confirms that C pneumoniae is a common finding in atherosclerotic plaques of the carotid artery but suggests that the presence of the infectious organism has little detectable impact on plaque instability when measured by clinically significant markers. This raises important questions for the rationale of antibiotic therapy in atherosclerosis.",
      "Moxibustion exerted its effect on healing impaired colonic mucosa in rats with TNBS-induced colitis by increasing the degranulation ratio of local MC, but had little effect on the morphology of MC at ST25 acupoint.",
      "Laser Doppler flowmetry detected circulatory abnormalities in primary open-angle glaucoma suspects who did not have any manifest visual field defect. Decreases in flow in glaucoma suspects were similar in magnitude to those of subjects with primary open-angle glaucoma. These data suggest that impaired optic nerve blood flow develops early in the glaucomatous process and does not develop solely as a result of glaucoma damage."
