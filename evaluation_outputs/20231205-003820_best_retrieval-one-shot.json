    "\n\nAnswer:\nYes, The review discusses and compares different procedures as reported in recent studies and how variables such as age, number of prior procedures, and type of glaucoma have clarified the order in which these procedures might be performed after failed angle surgery. The retrospective cohort study of a total of 61 patients (80 procedures) who had undergone trabeculectomy surgery after failed medical management at a single centre between 2000 and 2011, identified 61 patients (80 procedures) with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). The primary outcome was success of trabeculectomy surgery, with failure defined as intraocular pressure (IOP) > 21 mmHg, \u2264 5 mmHg or not reduced by 20% at two consecutive follow-up visits 3-months post-operatively. Qualified success was defined as surgical success with the use of supplemental medical therapy. Secondary outcomes included visual acuity, Humphrey visual field MD, surgical complications and post-operative interventions. The study found that almost 20% of angle procedures eventually fail, and surgeons are confronted with a choice of what procedure to do next: a trabeculectomy with or without adjunctive antifibrosis therapy, glaucoma drainage",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the present study tested the hypothesis that rosuvastatin treatment may attenuate left ventricular (LV) remodelling and dysfunction in the failing heart, which may be associated with alterations of Ca(2+)-regulatory protein. The study found that rosuvastatin prevented LV remodelling and dysfunction by increasing SERCA activity and reducing the increased IL-6 level and further elevated IL-10 level in the peri-infarct and remote zones of MI. The study also found that rosuvastatin reduced the decreased expression of SERCA2a and pSer16-PLB, and had no effect on PLB expression. Therefore, the beneficial effect of rosuvastatin on cardiac dysfunction is associated with alterations in calcium-regulatory proteins.",

    "\nAnswer:\nYes, p130 plays a central role in the regulation of cell cycle progression and is involved in the growth-inhibitory mechanism of TGF-beta in Rb mutant HT-3 cells. TGF-beta inhibited the proliferation of HT-3 cells expressing mutant Rb protein and efficiently induced cell-cycle arrest at G(1) phase. p21 protein level was elevated in TGF-beta-treated HT-3 cells, while other G(1) regulatory protein levels were unaltered. TGF-beta markedly enhanced the binding of p21 with cdk2 but decreased that of cdk2 with cyclin E and inhibited the phosphorylation of p130 but did not change Rb and p107 protein status. We also found that E2F-1 protein level was lower in TGF-beta-treated cells and suggest that this might be the result of enhanced binding between E2F-4 and p130.",

      "Our data show that, although angiogenesis can be effectively blocked by ZD6474, in vessel-dense organs this may result in sustained tumor progression via co-option, rather than in tumor dormancy. Importantly, blocking VEGF-A may result in undetectability of tumors in CE-MRI scans, leading to erroneous conclusions about therapeutic efficacy during magnetic resonance imaging follow-up. The maintenance of VEGF-A-induced vessel leakage in the absence of neovascularization at lower ZD6474 doses may be exploited to improve delivery of chemotherapeutic agents in combined treatment regimens of antiangiogenic and chemotherapeutic compounds.",

This study successfully illustrated the power of lipidomics in unraveling intervention effects and to help finding new targets or ingredients for lifestyle-related metabolic abnormality.",
      "Expression of nm23-H1/NDP kinase is strongly upregulated in most EOCs. Redundant overexpression of nm23-H1/NDP kinase may contribute to deranged cell cycle progression and EOC proliferation. Pattern and intensity of nm23-H1/NDP kinase immunostaining of EOC tissue retrieved at primary operation may identify patients at risk for tumor progression and help guide treatment strategies.

Furthermore, continued participation in weight-bearing exercise in early to mid-adulthood appears to be important for reducing the risk of low bone strength in old age.",
      "Unlike in mild and relatively early STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy, scarring of severely and chronically damaged kidneys is not attenuated by a 50% reduction of CCN2 to (near) normal levels. This suggests that CCN2 is either redundant in severe and chronic kidney disease, or that it is a limiting factor only at subnormal concentrations requiring further reduction by available or emerging therapies to prevent fibrosis of the severely injured kidney.",

MEANS TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS: Detection of multiple immunorelevant P. falciparum blood stage antigens could be achieved by two-dimensional electrophoresis and blotting of the antigens onto nitrocellulose followed by exposure to the participant's serum. Bound immunoglobulins are visualized by isotype specific peroxidase conjugated anti-human immunoglobulin and quantified by transmission densitometry. The resulting pattern of responses for each immunoglobulin isotype could be compared between clinically immune participants remaining asymptomatic with subsequent P. falciparum infections and people who develop malaria. Immunorelevant antigens are identifiable by mass spectrometry with the fully decoded P. falciparum genome.",
      "Results indicated that the involvement of multiple recombination detection programs is very necessary. Additionally, results suggested two major challenges, one involving the difficulty of accurately determining the locations of breakpoints and the second involving identification of small regions of about 200 bases or fewer with greater caution. Both indicate the complexity of HIV-1 recombination. The resolution would depend critically on development of a recombination analysis algorithm, accumulation of HIV-1 stains, and a higher sequencing quality. With the changes in recombination pattern, phylogenetic relationships of some CRFs may also change. All these results may be critical to understand the role of recombination in a complex and dynamic HIV evolution.",

      "In this study, we find that simple and complex ASEs undergo opposite selection pressure for protein reading frame preservation, with CSEs in-between. Simple ASEs have much higher FRFPs than complex ones. We further find that the FRFPs of complex ASEs coupled with flanking exons are close to those of simple ASEs, indicating that neighboring exons of an ASE may evolve in a coordinated way to avoid protein dysfunction. Therefore, we suggest that evolutionary analyses of AS should take into consideration the effects of different splicing patterns and the joint effects of multiple AS events.",
      "Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that HDGF was expressed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. High nuclear expression of HDGF was positively correlated with FIGO stage (P = 0.032), but not associated with other clinical features, such as histological grading or lymph node status. Patients with high expression of HDGF had poorer overall survival rates than those with low expression of HDGF (P = 0.001). However, multivariate analyses showed that high nuclear expression of HDGF protein was not an independent predictor of prognosis for EC patients (P = 0.111). Our results suggest that high nuclear expression of HDGF is a potential unfavorable factor for the progression and prognosis of EC.",
      "The results of our large, single-center, retrospective study suggest that the findings of a FDG-PET scan may be interesting in the initial assessment of patients with ECD, but its greater contribution is in followup of these patients.",
      "Over expression of UCP2 in certain tumors provides the rationale to speculate that UCP2 may promote tumor growth in these cancers.",
      "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading known genetic cause of autism spectrum disorders. Individuals with FXS show symptoms of auditory hypersensitivity. These symptoms may arise due to sustained neural responses to repeated sounds, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. For the first time, this study shows deficits in habituation of neural responses to repeated sounds in the Fmr1 KO mice as seen in humans with FXS. We also report an abnormally high level of matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) in the auditory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice and that deletion of Mmp-9 from Fmr1 KO mice reverses habituation deficits. These data provide a translation relevant electrophysiological biomarker for sensory deficits in FXS and implicate MMP-9 as a target for drug discovery.",

      "S 23521 is an effective glucagon-like peptide-1-(7-36) amide analogue, which induced a decrease in energy intake, body weight, and adiposity in a rat model of diet-induced obesity. In addition, the treatment also improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity of obese rats. These results strongly support S 23521 as a putative molecule for the treatment of obesity.",
      "Our study demonstrates that the age at first exposure to T. gondii is an important factor in shaping distinct behavioral and neurobiological abnormalities. Elevation in GLUN2 autoantibodies or complement protein C1q may be a potential underlying mechanism. A better understanding of these age-related differences may lead to more efficient treatments of behavioral disorders associated with T. gondii infection.",

      "These findings indicate that NGAL reduces apoptosis by regulating the four apoptosis factors Bcl-2, Bax, Fas and FasL through its two receptors 24p3R and megalin. These results also suggest that ectopic expression of NGAL in renal cells might provide a therapeutic strategy in ischemia-reperfusion by reducing apoptosis and promoting renal cell proliferation.",
      "Increased BMI is associated with increased diurnal strains in articular cartilage of both the medial and lateral compartments of the knee. The increased cartilage strains observed in individuals with high BMI may, in part, explain the elevated risk of OA associated with obesity or may reflect alterations in the cartilage mechanical properties in subjects with high BMI.",

      "Similar urinary flows and osmolalities are associated with levels of plasma vasopressin and renal PGE2, which are higher in males than in females. Oxytocin does not seem to play a role in the diurnal urine formation, whereas prostaglandin E2 could represent a mediator of the gender difference, not only as a mediator of the vasopressin response, but also as an independent factor. These findings need further elucidation.",
      "MICR has a very transient impact on plasma levels of endostatin and no impact on angiostatin during the first 21 days following surgery. Thus, angiostatin and endostatin do not likely contribute to or inhibit the persistent proangiogenic changes noted after MICR.",

      "These data provide evidence that there are no obvious adverse effects of acute or more chronic Cr supplementation on the haematological indices measured, nor on hepatic, muscle, and renal function. Therefore there is no apparent health risk associated with Cr supplementation to healthy people when it is ingested in quantities that have been scientifically proven to increase muscle Cr stores.",

      "All together, the pharmacological reactivity of STOP null mice to antipsychotics evokes the pharmacological response of humans to such drugs. Totally, our study suggests that STOP null mice may provide a useful preclinical model to evaluate pharmacological properties of antipsychotic drugs.",
      "This study confirms that C pneumoniae is a common finding in atherosclerotic plaques of the carotid artery but suggests that the presence of the infectious organism has little detectable impact on plaque instability when measured by clinically significant markers. This raises important questions for the rationale of antibiotic therapy in atherosclerosis.",

      "Laser Doppler flowmetry detected circulatory abnormalities in primary open-angle glaucoma suspects who did not have any manifest visual field defect. Decreases in flow in glaucoma suspects were similar in magnitude to those of subjects with primary open-angle glaucoma. These data suggest that impaired optic nerve blood flow develops early in the glaucomatous process and does not develop solely as a result of glaucoma damage."
