    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is characterized by dynamic impairment of active relaxation and contraction of the left ventricle on exercise and associated with myocardial energy deficiency.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study aimed to determine the role of soluble ( Pro ) Renin Receptor in predicting gestational diabetes mellitus. However, the provided context does not contain enough information to definitively answer this question. The context discusses the relationship between soluble ( Pro ) Renin Receptor and other parameters such as renal function, but it does not provide any information on how soluble ( Pro ) Renin Receptor relates to gestational diabetes mellitus specifically. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if soluble ( Pro ) Renin Receptor is a predictor of gestational diabetes mellitus based on the provided context.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, obvious emphysema on computed tomography during an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is reported to correlate with COPD prognosis.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the study compares levels of both genital mucosal and blood chemokines between HIV-1-uninfected and HIV-1-infected female commercial sex workers (CSWs) as well as HIV-1-uninfected non-CSW control women at low risk for exposure, recruited in Cotonou, Benin. The study found that genital inflammation during early HIV-1 infection predisposes women to rapid disease progression. The study also found that bacterial vaginosis (BV) is associated with HIV acquisition and that the female genital tract contains factors that affect HIV-1 replication. The study collected cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) samples from HIV-1-seropositive and seronegative women and added to cell cultures to determine whether the female genital tract contains factors that affect HIV-1 replication. The study also collected blood, cervicovaginal lavage, and biopsies of the uterine cervix taken quarterly for up to 5 years to compare cytokine/chemokine concentrations and the percent of tissue staining positive for T cells between non-shedding and shedding visits across all women and within a subgroup of women who intermittently shed HIV-1.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the pathological observation of lung injury in experimental animals induced by non-ferrous metal ( tin ) dust was described in the provided context. The context describes the process of carcinogenesis and pathologic alterations in various stages of malignant transformation in the animal models of lung cancer induced by Yunnan tin mineral dusts (no radon). The pathological changes observed in the rat lungs included scattered hoar tip size of the spots in surface and section of the lungs, scattered focal granulomatous inflammation around the small bronchi and dust particles in lung tissue, granulomatous inflammation increase, fibroblasts proliferation, collagen fibers formation and positive VG staining on the 90th day after exposure to tin dusts. These pathological changes were basically the characters of specific pathological changes in early tin pneumoconiosis.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the study investigates the methylation status of the retinoid acid receptor beta (RARbeta), cellular retinol-binding protein 1 (CRBP1), and tazarotene-induced gene 1 (TIG1) genes and their role in gastric carcinoma (GC). The study analyzed the DNA methylation of these three genes in 42 samples of GC from 42 patients and in 8 GC cell lines by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. The mRNA expression levels for these three genes were also measured by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study investigates whether the phenomenon of tumor angiogenesis in cerebral melanoma metastases is originated by elevated blood vessel density or by reactive hyperemia. The study aims to evaluate the recruitment of bone marrow-derived cells by the melanoma tumor, including endothelial cells, and if they contribute to angiogenesis. However, the study does not specifically address the question of whether antiangiogenic therapy of cerebral melanoma metastases results in sustained tumor progression via vessel co-option.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, clove and eugenol in noncytotoxic concentrations exert immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory action on cytokine production by murine macrophages. Clove (100\u00b5g/well) inhibited interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-10 production and exerted an efficient action either before or after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge for all cytokines. Eugenol did not affect IL-1\u03b2 production but inhibited IL-6 and IL-10 production. The action of eugenol (50 or 100\u00b5g/well) on IL-6 production prevented efficiently the effects of LPS either before or after its addition, whereas on IL-10 production it counteracted significantly LPS action when added after LPS incubation.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, pretreatment with stellate ganglion blockade before ischemia does not reduce infarct size in rat hearts. In fact, ganglionic blockade decreased blood pressure before the start of ischemia and plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine during ischemia (P < 0.05). Neurologic outcome was significantly worse in rats with high glucose compared with low glucose concentrations with and without ganglionic blockade (P < 0.05). Neurologic outcome and stroke-related mortality were worse in rats with increased plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine compared with rats with ganglionic blockade when plasma glucose was less than 300 mg/dl (P < 0.05).",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, lipidomics can reveal multiple pathway effects of a multi-components preparation on lipid biochemistry in ApoE*3Leiden.CETP mice. According to the provided context, the combination of lipidomic and gene expression analyses allows us to reveal the correlation between the altered lipid profile with significantly enriched pathways, such as one carbon pool by folate, arachidonic acid metabolism, insulin signaling pathway, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, propanoate metabolism, and starch and sucrose metabolism.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, elevated nm23 protein expression is not correlated with diminished progression-free survival in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma. The study found that the expression of nm23 protein was not significantly associated with progression-free survival in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, leukotriene B ( 4 ) potently enhances tumour necrosis factor-alpha-induced CCL27 secretion and mRNA expression in human keratinocytes.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, hemoglobin levels do not predict biochemical outcome for localized prostate cancer treated with neoadjuvant androgen-suppression therapy and external-beam radiotherapy. The study found that anemia is usually not taken into account in internal radiotherapy and that hemoglobin levels do not have an impact on the tumor response as observed in external beam radiotherapy.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Non-esterified fatty acids decreased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, insulin content and increased triglyceride content of human isolated islets, independently from the deleterious effect of glucose. Increased glucose concentrations also decreased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and insulin content, but had no influence on triglyceride content. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion of islets appeared to be significantly correlated with their triglyceride content.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, induction of oral tolerance to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) can ameliorate atherosclerosis. This was shown in a study where LDL receptor-/- mice fed a Western-type diet were treated with oxLDL or malondialdehyde-treated LDL (MDA-LDL) before the induction of atherogenesis. Oral tolerance to oxLDL resulted in a significant attenuation of the initiation and progression of atherogenesis. Additionally, tolerance to oxLDL induced a significant increase in CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ cells in spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes, and these cells specifically responded to oxLDL with increased transforming growth factor-beta production. In contrast, tolerance to MDA-LDL did not affect atherogenesis.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, in women with type 1 diabetes and insulin resistance, a more atherogenic cholesterol distribution by insulin resistance was seen.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the text states that almost 20% of angle procedures eventually fail, and surgeons are confronted with a choice of what procedure to do next: a trabeculectomy with or without adjunctive antifibrosis therapy, glaucoma drainage surgery, or cyclodestructive procedures.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the present study tested the hypothesis that rosuvastatin treatment may attenuate left ventricular (LV) remodelling and dysfunction in the failing heart, which may be associated with alterations of Ca(2+)-regulatory protein. The study found that rosuvastatin prevented LV remodelling and dysfunction by reducing the decrease of SERCA2a and pSer16-PLB expression, increasing SERCA activity, and reducing the increased IL-6 level and further elevating IL-10 level in the peri-infarct and remote zones of MI.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, prolonged resuscitation of metabolic acidosis after trauma is associated with more complications. The study found that in patients with successful resuscitation and controlled intracranial pressure (ICP), within 72 hours of trauma, 76% had low glucose, 93% had elevated lactate production rate (LPR), and 74% were in metabolic crisis. The duration of metabolic crisis was longer in those patients with unfavorable (GOSe \u2264 6) versus favorable (GOSe \u2265 7) outcome at 6 months (P = 0.011). In four multivariate models, the burden of metabolic crisis was a powerful independent predictor of poor outcome.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, nSC23925 has been shown to prevent the development of multidrug resistance (MDR) in ovarian cancer cells in vitro. Additionally, the study also evaluated the effects of nSC23925 on the prevention of MDR in ovarian cancer, especially in vivo. Human ovarian cancer cells were treated with paclitaxel alone or in combination with nSC23925 in vitro and in vivo. MDR ovarian cancer cells were established both in cultured cells and mouse models. The expression levels of Pgp and MDR1 were evaluated in various selected cell sublines by Western blot and real-time PCR. Pgp activity was also determined.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, restoration of klotho expression induces apoptosis and autophagy in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, there is evidence to suggest that leukocytosis is proportional to the severity of HELLP syndrome. In a study of 177 patients with preeclampsia, those with HELLP syndrome had significantly higher white blood cell counts than those with severe preeclampsia alone. Additionally, patients with class I HELLP syndrome had significantly higher white blood cell counts than patients with other classes of HELLP syndrome. This suggests that leukocytosis may be a key feature of the inflammatory form of preeclampsia that is associated with HELLP syndrome.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the study found that DcR3 overexpression correlated with lymph node metastases and TNM stages in pancreatic head carcinoma. Additionally, the median overall survival for the high DcR3 group was 16.3 months, compared to 21.6 months for the low DcR3 group (P < 0.05).",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, a Multi-Component Prime-Boost Vaccination Regimen with a Consensus MOMP Antigen enhances Chlamydia trachomatis Clearance. The DNA-HuAd5-MVA-Protein vaccine regimen induced a cellular response with a Th1-biased serum antibody response, alongside high serum and vaginal MOMP-specific antibodies. This regimen significantly enhanced clearance against intravaginal C. trachomatis serovar D infection in both BALB/c and B6C3F1 mouse strains. This enhanced clearance was shown to be CD4(+) T-cell dependent.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the angiotensin II type 2 receptor agonist Compound 21 (C21) was found to be protective in experimental diabetes-associated atherosclerosis (DAA) in vivo and in vitro. C21 treatment significantly attenuated aortic plaque deposition in a mouse model of DAA, in association with a decreased infiltration of macrophages and mediators of inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis. Additionally, C21 was found to confer profound anti-atherosclerotic actions at the in vitro level, particularly in the setting of hyperglycaemia. These atheroprotective actions of C21 were completely blocked by the AT2R antagonist PD123319. However, the combination therapy with C21 and candesartan (AT1R antagonist) appeared to have a limited additive effect in attenuating the pathology of DAA when compared with either treatment alone.",
    "\n\nAnswer: It is unclear whether cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is independently linked to cardiometabolic risk in children. This study investigated the association between CRF level and presence of cardiometabolic risk disorders using health-related cut points, and whether these associations were mediated by abdominal adiposity in children. However, the strong relation between CRF and adiposity renders their independent associations to metabolic risk factors difficult to ascertain. Therefore, it is not clear whether fitness and adiposity are independently associated with cardiometabolic risk in youth.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, patient-prosthesis mismatch in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement can affect survival. The study found that patients with prosthesis-patient mismatch had significantly higher transprosthesis gradients postoperatively and an independent detrimental effect of prosthesis-patient mismatch on survival was observed in patients with aortic stenosis/mixed disease who had preoperative left ventricular dysfunction. In addition, the degree of prosthesis-patient mismatch was a significant predictor of poorer survival, even after adjustment for all significant clinical predictors.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, a high frequency of competitive sports early in life is associated with greater bone mineral density (BMD) at several bone sites in older men. This indicates that increases in BMD following physical activity (PA) are preserved longer than previously believed. However, it is unclear if the positive effects of PA remain at old age.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, hemizygous deletion of CTGF/CCN2 does not suffice to prevent fibrosis of the severely injured kidney. The study examined the effects of CCN2 haploinsufficiency on the progression of renal scarring in long-term STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy, in a more advanced stage of obstructive nephropathy following unilateral ureteric obstruction (UUO), and in severe aristolochic acid (AA)-induced tubulotoxic nephritis. The results showed that CCN2 haploinsufficiency did not prevent fibrosis of the severely injured kidney.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the study found that severity of hepatic encephalopathy before orthotopic liver transplantation correlated with quality of life after transplantation.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, sutureless securement device StatLock has been shown to reduce catheter-related complications when compared to tape in earlier studies. The purpose of the current study was to determine whether a sutureless securement device offers an advantage over suture in preventing catheter-related complications. The study randomized 170 patients requiring PICCs to suture or StatLock securement and prospectively studied them throughout their entire catheter course. The results showed that StatLock significantly reduced catheter-related complications including dislodgment, infection, occlusion, leakage, and central venous thrombosis when compared to the suture group.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, attachment of synovial fibroblasts (SFs) to laminin-111 facilitates transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta)-induced expression of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) in SFs. Incubation of SFs on laminin-111 in the presence of TGFbeta induced a significant 12-fold higher expression of MMP-3 mRNA, and secretion of MMP-3 was elevated 20-fold above controls.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, functional health literacy is associated with health status and health-related knowledge in people living with HIV-AIDS. HIV-infected people with lower health literacy had lower CD4 cell counts, higher viral loads, were less likely to be taking antiretroviral medications, reported a greater number of hospitalizations, and reported poorer health than those with higher health literacy. In addition, after adjusting for years of formal education, lower health literacy was associated with poorer knowledge of one's HIV-related health status, poorer AIDS-related disease and treatment knowledge, and more negative health care perceptions and experiences.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, a trans-aortic Alfieri stitch can be placed at the time of septal myectomy for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. This technique was described in a document stating that an Alfieri stitch is placed in the mitral valve through the aortotomy while performing septal myectomy.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study found that computer-assisted instruction (CAI) tutorial program improved clinical reasoning skills of undergraduate dietetics students. However, the improvement was not statistically significant in all areas. Seventy-six percent of students found the OSCE to be superior to the medical center experience, and 78% of students agreed that collaboration with other healthcare professionals helped prepare them for the dietetic role.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, soy protein isolates of varied isoflavone content can influence serum thyroid hormones in healthy young men. A study was conducted where 35 healthy young men supplemented their habitual diets with milk protein isolate (MPI), low-isoflavone soy protein isolate (low-iso SPI; 1.64 +/- 0.19 mg iso/day), and high-isoflavone SPI (high-iso SPI; 61.7 +/- 7.4 mg iso/day) for 57 days each, separated by 4-week washouts in a randomized crossover design. Blood was collected on days 1, 29, and 57 of each treatment for analysis of total triiodothyronine (T3), free T3, total thyroxine (T4), free T4, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and thyroid binding globulin (TBG). The results showed that consumption of soy protein of varying isoflavone content can influence serum thyroid hormones in healthy young men.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, immunity to blood stages of Plasmodium falciparum is dependent on a specific pattern of immunoglobulin subclass responses to multiple blood stage antigens.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the reanalysis of recombination patterns of some HIV-1 circulating recombination forms (CRFs) suggests the necessity and difficulty of revision. The current study was based on multiple recombination analysis, which may have produced more impartial results. The study found that revisions may be necessary for other CRFs.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, osteopontin (OPN) has been identified as the most highly upregulated factor early after neonatal cerebral hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury. Therefore, it is likely that OPN plays a role in endogenous repair after HI brain injury. However, further research is needed to determine the specific mechanisms by which OPN enhances repair and to identify other molecules that may be involved in the repair process.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, xenon pretreatment attenuates anesthetic-induced apoptosis in the developing brain in comparison with nitrous oxide and hypoxia.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, p130 plays a role in TGF-beta-induced cell-cycle arrest in Rb mutant HT-3 cells. TGF-beta inhibited the proliferation of HT-3 cells expressing mutant Rb protein and efficiently induced cell-cycle arrest at G(1) phase. p21 protein level was elevated in TGF-beta-treated HT-3 cells, while other G(1) regulatory protein levels were unaltered. TGF-beta markedly enhanced the binding of p21 with cdk2 but decreased that of cdk2 with cyclin E and inhibited the phosphorylation of p130 but did not change Rb and p107 protein status. E2F-1 protein level was lower in TGF-beta-treated cells and suggest that this might be the result of enhanced binding between E2F-4 and p130.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, past cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3, obesity, and earlier menopause are associated with an increased risk of vulval cancer in postmenopausal women.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, degree of coronary stenosis is correlated to cerebrovascular reactivity. However, severity of coronary artery disease is associated with disturbed cerebrovascular reactivity.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the objective of the study was to examine the association of family-centered rounds with family experiences and health services use. The study was a prospective study comparing families with a child admitted to general pediatric inpatient services with and without FCR. The presence of FCR elements was assessed before study enrollment. Study data were obtained by an in-person interview, a follow-up phone interview <1 week after discharge, and medical record review. Family outcomes were informed by Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems measures. Health service use outcomes included hour of discharge, number of medications, and overall charges. Primary analyses included \u03c7(2) and multivariate regression. Secondary analyses by using propensity score matching were performed to account for differences on observed variables.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, high doses of EDU were not toxic to the fast-growing willow species and did not affect the C content and distribution within the plant body. However, EDU did increase the leaf N content. Additionally, EDU was not persistent in the soil and water extracts of willow leaves were prepared for further studies. It is important to note that the understanding of regulatory elements involved in N response is very limited and more research is needed to delineate these responses at the transcriptional level when plants are grown under chronic N stress.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, high maternal body mass index (BMI) increases the risk of neonatal early onset group B streptococcal (EOGBS) disease. In obese parturients with BMI > 30, there was an 80% increased risk for verified neonatal EOGBS disease. When cases with clinical sepsis were included, a significant risk increment was also found in overweight women with BMI 25.0-29.9.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) decreases acute pneumonitis after irradiation in both in vitro and in vivo studies. In vitro studies showed that CAPE decreased the expression of inflammatory cytokines including IL-1 alpha and beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha and TGF-beta, after irradiation. Moreover, histological and immunochemical data revealed that CAPE decreased radiation-induced interstitial pneumonitis and TGF-beta expression. In vivo studies also showed that CAPE treatment decreased the expression of inflammatory cytokines and decreased radiation-induced interstitial pneumonitis.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study aimed to assess the effects of early thymoglobulin administration on cardiocyte nuclear status in orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) recipients. However, the study did not specifically investigate the effects of thymoglobulin on early myocardial hypertrophy assessed by morphometric studies. The study evaluated endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs) from 31 OHT recipients and 10 control cases and performed morphometric studies using a computerized, automated Quantimet image analysis system. The study found no significant difference in cardiocyte nuclear area, length, breadth, perimeter, chromatin median grey level, and fullness factor between the standard group (treated without thymoglobulin), the ATG group (received thymoglobulin electively), and the standard+ATG group (administered thymoglobulin upon a drop in renal function). Therefore, the study did not provide evidence to support the claim that thymoglobulin administered early after heart transplantation reduces early myocardial hypertrophy assessed by morphometric studies.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, dNA-PKcs expression was found to be a predictor of biochemical recurrence after permanent iodine-125 interstitial brachytherapy for prostate cancer. In the study, positive dNA-PKcs nuclear staining was closely associated with biochemical recurrence. On multivariate analysis, dNA-PKcs status remained predictive of recurrence along with the Gleason score and prostate-specific antigen level.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, chemotherapy for cancer does not cause apoptosis that precedes hypoplasia in crypts of the small intestine in humans. According to the provided context, chemotherapy induces apoptosis in esophageal cancer, but no windows of opportunity exist to selectively kill tumor cells without killing host cells. Additionally, the relevance of apoptosis to breast cancer response to chemotherapy is unclear. While apoptosis is an essential form of cell death, the provided context does not mention any specific effects of chemotherapy on the small intestine or its crypts.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, alveolar macrophage gene expression is altered in the setting of alcohol use disorders. A study was conducted on alveolar macrophages obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage from a test cohort of subjects with AUDs and controls who were pair-matched on age, gender, and smoking. Probe set expression differences in this cohort were validated by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT RT-PCR). Functional analysis with web-based bioinformatics tools was utilized with microarray data to assess differentially expressed candidate genes (p < 0.01) based on alcohol consumption. Alveolar macrophage mRNA samples from a second cohort of subjects with AUDs and controls were used to confirm gene expression differences related to AUDs.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, a diminished postnatal surge of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants is not additional evidence for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The study found that the number of Ad spermatogonia in unilateral cryptorchid testes correlated in a nonlinear fashion with those in the contralateral scrotal testes, indicating that the development of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants is not affected by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, female children were nearly three times more likely to be stunted than male children. Households that were food insecure with hunger were also three times more likely than other households to have a stunted child.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, combination therapy with VELCADE and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is neuroprotective in aged rats after stroke and targets microRNA-146a and the toll-like receptor signaling pathway. The study found that combination treatment with VELCADE and tPA modulates the TLR signaling pathway on cerebral vasculature, which leads to neuroprotection in aged rats after stroke. The study also found that the combination treatment increased miR-l46a levels, which was inversely associated with the reduction of vascular interleukin-1 receptor-activated kinases 1 immunoreactivity. In vitro, fibrin upregulated interleukin-1 receptor-activated kinases 1 and TLR4 expression and downregulated miR-146a on primary human cerebral endothelial cells. VELCADE elevated miR-146 levels and abolished fibrin-increased interleukin-1 receptor activated kinases 1 proteins.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, peak weight velocity in infancy is positively associated with spirometric lung function indices at 15 years of age.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, the provided context does not mention anything about S-allylmercaptocysteine being a hepato-protective agent in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in vivo animal model. The context only mentions that S-allylmercaptocysteine has cancer-preventive and tumor-suppressive effects and was tested in vivo for the first time in a study that aimed to evaluate its potential as an antimetastatic drug.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the proportion of time in which chest compressions are performed in each minute of cardiopulmonary resuscitation is an important modifiable aspect of quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation and has been shown to determine survival to hospital discharge in patients with out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, expression of snail in pancreatic cancer promotes metastasis and chemoresistance. In the study, snail expression was found to be correlated with lymph node invasion and distant metastasis in pancreatic cancer. After transfecting snail cDNA into pancreatic cancer cell line Panc-1, it was found that snail triggered overt epithelial to mesenchymal transitions in Panc-1 cells, promoting the invasive ability of the cells. Additionally, overexpression of snail enhanced the chemoresistance of Panc-1 cells to 5-fluorouracil and gemcitabine at different dosages. The study also found that snail-transfected Panc-1 cells produced more spontaneous metastasis than parental untransfected cells after orthotopically injected into the pancreas of nude mice.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, knockdown of SLUG by RNA interference significantly inhibited lung cancer cell invasion and metastasis.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, postoperative CMF does not ameliorate poor outcomes in women with residual invasive breast cancer after neoadjuvant epirubicin/docetaxel chemotherapy. The study included 36 women with moderately advanced local breast cancer larger than 2 cm in diameter. Twelve were allocated to receive a standard regimen of 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (FEC) preoperatively as controls, and 24 were given the most suitable regimen according to testing; the options were FEC, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF), 5-fluorouracil, adriamycin and mitomycin C (FAM) and paclitaxel alone. The cell activities of drug-treated solid tumors were compared to controls with a highly sensitive ATP bioluminescence assay. Patients received chemotherapy according to sensitivity results and the tumor area clinically measured before and after chemotherapy. The study did not find that postoperative CMF ameliorated poor outcomes in women with residual invasive breast cancer after neoadjuvant epirubicin/docetaxel chemotherapy.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The WD40 domain is required for LRRK2 neurotoxicity. Removing the WD40 domain prevents complex formation and autophosphorylation, and completely blocks the neurotoxicity of multiple LRRK2 PD mutations.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the hypothesis that inhibition of leukocyte function by administration of monoclonal antibody 60.3 (MoAb 60.3) improves electrophysiological recovery and decreases injury volume following transient focal cerebral ischemia in cats is supported by the results of the study.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, prenatal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure during the final 2 weeks of pregnancy can induce schizophrenia-like behavioral symptoms, such as deficits in sensorimotor gating (prepulse inhibition) and impairments in social interactions and exploration, in adult offspring. Additionally, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that in the neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia, decreases in the total number of PV- and GAD67-positive neurons in the medial prefrontal cortices of adult females prenatally exposed to LPS were observed, whereas these immunochemical changes were primarily detected in the hippocampus of males. Furthermore, a decrease in PV-labeled axon terminals of GABA-ergic cells, likely reflecting the perisomatic inhibitory innervation of pyramidal neurons, was observed in the medial prefrontal cortices in both sexes.\n\nCompared to the control group, the LPS-treated dams presented reduced maternal behavior, decreased general activity, a smaller body weight difference between GD21 and PND1, a greater number of perinatal deaths, and smaller litters. For the male pups, LPS treatment resulted in a decreased body weight on PND2",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (AFABP) levels are significantly elevated in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) versus control and correlate with indices of adiposity. AFABP is a key mediator of inflammatory response in macrophages and has been observed to be increased in patients with NAFLD. Additionally, AFABP has been associated with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in type 2 diabetes.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, timing variability during gait initiation is increased in people with Alzheimer's disease compared to controls.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, as a pitcher approaches muscular fatigue during a simulated baseball game, pitching biomechanics will be significantly different than they were before muscular fatigue.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the bisphosphonate Pamidronate has been shown to improve chemically induced trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid and dextran sulfate sodium colitis in rats and lymphocyte transfer colitis in mice. Pamidronate has no effect on intestinal epithelial cells in vitro in terms of cytokine/chemokine release, but enhances IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, and IL-10 production by T cells in coculture. Pamidronate also exerts a direct immunomodulatory effect on T cells, favoring Th1 differentiation and impairing Th17 polarization.",
    "\n\nAnswer: There is no information provided in the context to support the statement that experience with bilateral cochlear implants improves sound localization acuity in children. However, it is mentioned that a feasible and reliable task for children who are deaf is the right-left discrimination task, which enables measurement of the smallest angle from midline that can be reliably discriminated (minimum audible angle [MAA]). This task can be used to evaluate sound localization ability in children with cochlear implants.",
    "\n\nAnswer: There is no information provided in the context to suggest that gM-CSF contributes to prompt healing of ecthyma gangrenosum lesions in kidney transplant recipients.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, pterygium is related to a decrease in corneal endothelial cell density. The study found a strong logarithmic correlation between a decrease in the corneal ECD and the percentage of pterygium to cornea.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study suggests that long-term reversal of hypocholesterolaemia in patients with chronic hepatitis C is related to sustained viral response and viral genotype. The study found that genotype-3 of HCV patients had age-adjusted hypocholesterolaemia and more frequent hepatic steatosis. Steatosis was inversely correlated with serum cholesterol and directly with viral load. In patients with genotype-3 of HCV and sustained viral response, serum cholesterol increased from 138 (95% CI: 120-151) to 180 mg/dL (95% CI: 171-199) 12 months after treatment conclusion (P < 0.0001). By contrast, cholesterol values were unchanged in genotype-3 of HCV non-responders and in patients with genotype-1 of HCV regardless of response. The study also found that elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels and statin use have been associated with higher sustained virological response (SVR) rates in patients receiving chronic hepatitis C therapy. However, the relationship between high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and virological response is not well characterized.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The present study aimed to see if life style interventions/weight reduction could decrease cathepsin L and S levels in blood plasma. However, the provided context does not mention any specific association between life style interventions and decreased levels of cathepsins L and S in moderately overweight individuals.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, the study did not find a significant association between the novel polymorphism of the CYP19 gene and essential hypertension in China.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, different alternative splicing patterns may be subject to opposite selection pressure for protein reading frame preservation. Simple alternative spliced exons (ASEs) have higher frequency of reading frame preservation (FRFP) than constitutively spliced exons (CSEs), while complex ASEs have lower FRFP than CSEs. This suggests that the selection pressure on frame preservation is likely relaxed in complex ASEs. Additionally, conservation of the ASE/CSE splicing pattern increases the FRFPs of simple ASEs but decreases those of complex ASEs. Therefore, it is necessary to re-evaluate the evolutionary effects of such splicing patterns on frame preservation.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, high nuclear expression of HDGF correlates with disease progression and poor prognosis in human endometrial carcinoma. A study examined the correlation between high nuclear expression of HDGF and clinicopathologic data in endometrial carcinoma (EC), including patient survival. The study found that higher HDGF expression rate was 52.76% in EOC. HDGF expression was significantly associated with lymphatic metastasis (P=0.006). Higher HDGF expression was closely correlated to poorer 5-year overall survival rate with univariate analysis (P=0.003), and was identified as an independent prognostic factor with multivariate analysis (P=0.007).",
    "\n\nAnswer: The provided context does not mention Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) specifically, but it does mention whole-body scanning with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in a large cohort of ECD patients. However, the context does not provide any information about the usefulness of FDG-PET scanning in the initial assessment or follow-up of patients with ECD. Therefore, it is not possible to answer the question based on the provided context.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) was significantly higher in tumor tissues of the human head and neck, skin, prostate, and pancreatic tumor samples examined compared to the adjacent normal tissues.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the study demonstrates that a genetic deletion of Mmp9 reverses ERP habituation deficits in Fmr1 KO mice. Although the N1 amplitude of Mmp9/Fmr1 DKO recordings was larger than WT and KO recordings, the habituation of ERPs in Mmp9/Fmr1 DKO mice is similar to WT mice, implicating MMP-9 as a potential target for reversing sensory processing deficits in FXS.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, air quality can influence the prevalence of hay fever and sinusitis. The National Health Interview Survey for the calendar years 1997-2006 adult sample was analyzed to determine for each calendar year the one-year period prevalence of the two respiratory conditions, hay fever and sinusitis and the nonrespiratory (control) condition, weak/failing kidneys. From the Environmental Protection Agency, yearly historical data for air quality criteria pollutants, carbon monoxide, nitrous dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter, were tabulated. Graphical and linear regression analyses were conducted for each disease condition against each of the air quality variables to determine if higher pollutant concentrations predicted a higher prevalence for the disease condition.\n\nAdditionally, nasal irritation and associated symptoms (nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and sinus headache) are important elements of the response to indoor and outdoor air pollution. Marked interindividual variability in such symptoms has been suggested clinically and epidemiologically, but little experimental data exist on this issue.\n\nFurthermore, sinusitis involves an inflammatory response with similarities to asthma.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, S 23521 decreases food intake and body weight gain in diet-induced obese rats.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study suggests that the age during first exposure to Toxoplasma gondii may affect symptom manifestation. Juvenile and adult infected mice exhibited opposite effects of MK-801 on PPI, with decreased PPI in juveniles and increased PPI in adults. There was a significantly greater elevation of GLUN2 autoantibodies in juvenile-compared to adult-infected mice. In addition, age-dependent differences were found in regional expression of NMDAR subunits and markers of glutamatergic, GABAergic, and monoaminergic systems. Activated microglia and C1q elevations were found in both juvenile- and adult-T. gondii infected mice. However, the role of anti-NMDAR autoantibodies in neurobehavioral pathology in mice is not clear and requires further investigation.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, risedronate gastrointestinal absorption is not independent of site and rate of administration. In study A, no statistically significant site-specific differences in any pharmacokinetic parameter were observed. Based on the area under the serum concentration-time profile and the amount of drug excreted in the urine unchanged, the extent of risedronate absorption did not differ significantly following a rapid or a slow infusion in study B.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study aimed to elucidate the role of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) in regulating apoptosis of tubular epithelial cells in a hypoxia-reperfusion model. However, the provided context does not contain any information about whether NGAL protects renal tubular epithelial cells in hypoxia-reperfusion by reducing apoptosis.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, high body mass index (BMI) is associated with increased diurnal strains in the articular cartilage of the knee. Subjects with high BMI had significantly thicker cartilage on both the patella and femoral groove, as compared to subjects with normal BMI. Diurnal cartilage strains were dependent on location in the knee joint, as well as BMI. Subjects with high BMI, compared to those with normal BMI, exhibited significantly higher compressive strains in the tibial cartilage. However, there was no significant effect of BMI on diurnal cartilage strain in the femur.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, corticosterone is involved in the biochemical mechanisms of electroacupuncture (EA) anti-inflammation in a rat model of inflammation. In the study, EA significantly increased plasma corticosterone levels 2 hours and 5 hours after complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) administration compared to sham EA control. Adrenalectomy blocked EA-produced anti-edema, but not EA anti-hyperalgesia.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, soluble oncoprotein 185HER-2 in pleural fluid has limited usefulness for the diagnostic evaluation of malignant effusions. Pleural sp185(HER-2) levels greater than 25 ng/mL were observed in 20% of breast and 10% of lung adenocarcinomas, and predicted a malignant effusion with a sensitivity of 7% and a likelihood ratio of 7.6. However, the combination of CEA and CA 15-3 resulted in 50% sensitivity, while adding sp185(HER-2) to this panel nonsignificantly increased sensitivity by 5%. Only 1 patient with breast adenocarcinoma among 45 cytology-negative malignant effusions had sp185(HER-2) above the diagnostic cutoff point. Therefore, soluble oncoprotein 185HER-2 in pleural fluid has limited usefulness for the diagnostic evaluation of malignant effusions.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, the study did not investigate the effects of Bevacizumab on mitochondria isolated from human brain tumors. The study only investigated the direct effects of Temozolomide and Bevacizumab on the function of mitochondria and compared these effects on mitochondria isolated from low- and high-grade human brain tumors.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study found no difference in diurnal urine regulation between genders.

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, adherence to the 2006 American Heart Association Diet and Lifestyle Recommendations (AHA-DLR) is associated with bone health in older Puerto Ricans. A cross-sectional study of 933 Puerto Ricans aged 47-79 y was conducted to test the association of the AHA-DLS (American Heart Association Diet and Lifestyle Score) with bone health. Bone mineral density (BMD) at the femoral neck, trochanter, total hip, and lumbar spine (L2-L4) was measured by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The results showed that adherence to the AHA-DLR was associated with higher BMD at all bone sites.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, basophils are recruited to inflamed lungs in mice and humans and exacerbate memory Th2 responses. In mice, prolonged basophil/CD4 T cell interactions were observed in lungs but not lymph nodes (LNs) of parasite-infected mice. In humans, basophils were purified from the lungs of ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized and OVA-challenged (OVA-immunized) mice or human peripheral blood for in vivo and in vitro functional studies. Pulmonary basophils were adoptively transferred to OVA-sensitized hosts to assess airway inflammation in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and Th2 responses in lung explants and draining LNs. Basophils were co-cultured with effector T cells or Ag-specific na\u00efve T cells alone or in combination with dendritic cells (DCs); IL-4 production was determined by flow cytometry and ELISA. Several studies in mice have recently shown that basophils can act as antigen-presenting cells (APC) inducing Th2-mediated immune responses against parasites or protease allergens. The aim of this study was to investigate whether human basophils function as APC for the major",

The context discusses other studies and experiments related to Walker 256 tumor-bearing rats, such as the effects of hepatic arterial ligation, octreotide, VEGF, and metformin on tumor growth and metabolism, but none of them involve beta-hydroxy beta-methylbutyrate supplementation.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, nT-ProBNP can predict rhythm stability after cardioversion of lone atrial fibrillation. The study found that patients with increased nT-ProBNP serum levels before cardioversion were more likely to experience a relapse of AF after restoration of sinus rhythm. Additionally, the study found that an optimal cutpoint for nT-ProBNP at 500 ng/L predicted recurrence of AF after cardioversion. Furthermore, nT-ProBNP had an incremental value over echocardiographic characteristics to predict AF recurrence after RFCA.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No indication of impairment to the haematological indices measured, hepatic function, or muscle damage was apparent after Cr supplementation. In contrast to previous reports, no detrimental effects of creatine supplementation on the renal function indices were observed in two-thirds nephrectomized or sham-operated animals. No differences were observed in inulin (0.28+/-0.08 vs 0.25+/-0.08 ml/min/100 g; P=NS) or creatinine clearance rates. Serum cystatin C concentration, urinary protein excretion, and albumin and urea clearance were comparable between creatine-supplemented and control-diet fed animals in both sham-operated and two-thirds nephrectomized animals. Serum creatine and intramuscular total creatine concentrations were higher in creatine-supplemented groups (P<0.05).",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the cAMP effectors Epac and PKA are involved in the hepatic cystogenesis of an animal model of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease ( ARPKD ). The study found that both normal and PCK cholangiocytes increase their growth upon Epac-specific stimulation, while PKA-specific stimulation results in cyst growth. Additionally, the study found that Epac isoforms and the PKA RIbeta subunit were overexpressed in cultured PCK cholangiocytes.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, chronic administration of both risperidone and clozapine results in alleviation of behavioral alterations mimicking some negative symptoms and partial amelioration of some cognitive defects in STOP null mice.

    "\n\nAnswer: The study was designed to clarify whether the association between chlamydia pneumoniae and atherosclerotic disease is based on C pneumoniae-induced transformation of a stable into an unstable atherosclerotic plaque or on stimulation of hypercoagulability leading to increased thrombotic arterial occlusions by C pneumoniae infection. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonographic monitoring of the middle cerebral artery during carotid endarterectomy offers the opportunity to study, before removal of the plaque, atherothrombotic emboli dislodging from an unstable carotid plaque (plaque-related emboli) and emboli related to (excessive) thrombus formation at the endarterectomy site after removal of the plaque and restoration of flow (thrombosis-related emboli). The study found that the presence of chlamydia pneumoniae correlates with plaque instability in patients with advanced carotid artery atherosclerosis.",

      "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading known genetic cause of autism spectrum disorders. Individuals with FXS show symptoms of auditory hypersensitivity. These symptoms may arise due to sustained neural responses to repeated sounds, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. For the first time, this study shows deficits in habituation of neural responses to repeated sounds in the Fmr1 KO mice as seen in humans with FXS. We also report an abnormally high level of matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) in the auditory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice and that deletion of Mmp-9 from Fmr1 KO mice reverses habituation deficits. These data provide a translation relevant electrophysiological biomarker for sensory deficits in FXS and implicate MMP-9 as a target for drug discovery.",
      "Prevalence of hay fever and sinusitis are correlated with air quality. Improvements in air quality are associated with decreased prevalence of both hay fever and sinusitis. Laryngoscope, 2009.",
      "S 23521 is an effective glucagon-like peptide-1-(7-36) amide analogue, which induced a decrease in energy intake, body weight, and adiposity in a rat model of diet-induced obesity. In addition, the treatment also improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity of obese rats. These results strongly support S 23521 as a putative molecule for the treatment of obesity.",
      "Our study demonstrates that the age at first exposure to T. gondii is an important factor in shaping distinct behavioral and neurobiological abnormalities. Elevation in GLUN2 autoantibodies or complement protein C1q may be a potential underlying mechanism. A better understanding of these age-related differences may lead to more efficient treatments of behavioral disorders associated with T. gondii infection.",
      "These studies indicate that the rate and extent of risedronate absorption are independent of the site of administration along the gastrointestinal tract, and that the extent of absorption is not affected by the rate of administration.",
      "These findings indicate that NGAL reduces apoptosis by regulating the four apoptosis factors Bcl-2, Bax, Fas and FasL through its two receptors 24p3R and megalin. These results also suggest that ectopic expression of NGAL in renal cells might provide a therapeutic strategy in ischemia-reperfusion by reducing apoptosis and promoting renal cell proliferation.",
      "Increased BMI is associated with increased diurnal strains in articular cartilage of both the medial and lateral compartments of the knee. The increased cartilage strains observed in individuals with high BMI may, in part, explain the elevated risk of OA associated with obesity or may reflect alterations in the cartilage mechanical properties in subjects with high BMI.",
      "The data demonstrate that EA activates the adrenals to increase plasma corticosterone levels and suppress edema and suggest that EA effects differ in healthy subjects and in those with pathologies.",
      "Measurement of pleural fluid sp185(HER-2) has poor diagnostic performance in patients with malignant effusions.",
      "TMZ and BEV can directly cause the dysfunction of mitochondria isolated from human brain tumors. However, BEV has a greater ability to disturb mitochondrial function in mitochondria isolated from human brain tumors than either TMZ or calcium overload conditions.",
      "Similar urinary flows and osmolalities are associated with levels of plasma vasopressin and renal PGE2, which are higher in males than in females. Oxytocin does not seem to play a role in the diurnal urine formation, whereas prostaglandin E2 could represent a mediator of the gender difference, not only as a mediator of the vasopressin response, but also as an independent factor. These findings need further elucidation.",
      "MICR has a very transient impact on plasma levels of endostatin and no impact on angiostatin during the first 21 days following surgery. Thus, angiostatin and endostatin do not likely contribute to or inhibit the persistent proangiogenic changes noted after MICR.",
      "Dietary guidelines for CVD risk reduction may also benefit bone health in this Hispanic cohort. Synchronizing dietary guidelines for these 2 common diseases may provide a simplified public health message. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01231958.",
      "Basophils may worsen Th2 inflammatory disorders through direct interactions with pathogenic CD4 T cells as well as by enhancing DC-induced Th2 cell development.",
      "We conclude that inhibition of TLR4 with eritoran in an in situ murine model significantly reduces MI/R injury and markers of an inflammatory response.",
      "HMbeta supplementation can increase survival time and promotes metabolic changes in cancer-bearing animals, but it seems to work in a time-dependent manner.",
      "The probability of a successful cardioversion correlates inversely with NT-proBNP values. The short-term success of a cardioversion might be predicted by prior determination of NT-proBNP.",
      "These data provide evidence that there are no obvious adverse effects of acute or more chronic Cr supplementation on the haematological indices measured, nor on hepatic, muscle, and renal function. Therefore there is no apparent health risk associated with Cr supplementation to healthy people when it is ingested in quantities that have been scientifically proven to increase muscle Cr stores.",
      "Our data provide strong evidence that both cAMP effectors, Epac and PKA, and the levels of intracellular calcium are involved in the hepatic cystogenesis of ARPKD.",
      "All together, the pharmacological reactivity of STOP null mice to antipsychotics evokes the pharmacological response of humans to such drugs. Totally, our study suggests that STOP null mice may provide a useful preclinical model to evaluate pharmacological properties of antipsychotic drugs.",
      "This study confirms that C pneumoniae is a common finding in atherosclerotic plaques of the carotid artery but suggests that the presence of the infectious organism has little detectable impact on plaque instability when measured by clinically significant markers. This raises important questions for the rationale of antibiotic therapy in atherosclerosis.",
      "Moxibustion exerted its effect on healing impaired colonic mucosa in rats with TNBS-induced colitis by increasing the degranulation ratio of local MC, but had little effect on the morphology of MC at ST25 acupoint.",
      "Laser Doppler flowmetry detected circulatory abnormalities in primary open-angle glaucoma suspects who did not have any manifest visual field defect. Decreases in flow in glaucoma suspects were similar in magnitude to those of subjects with primary open-angle glaucoma. These data suggest that impaired optic nerve blood flow develops early in the glaucomatous process and does not develop solely as a result of glaucoma damage."
