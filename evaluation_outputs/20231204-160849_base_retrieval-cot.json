    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is characterized by dynamic impairment of active relaxation and contraction of the left ventricle on exercise and associated with myocardial energy deficiency.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the study aims to determine the role of soluble ( Pro ) Renin Receptor in predicting gestational diabetes mellitus.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, obvious emphysema on computed tomography during an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) is reported to correlate with COPD prognosis. This study aims to study the relationship between prognosis and emphysematous changes on CT during an AECOPD. Histories were recorded, and CT acquired for 106 patients who visited the emergency department for an AECOPD. Emphysematous change was quantified by measuring the percentage of low-attenuation areas (LAA%) in the entire lung on CT images with a threshold of -950 Hounsfield units. Other factors that could influence AECOPD prognosis were also recorded on admission and analysed. At follow ups conducted in 1 year, patient survival, the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnoea Scale, and performance status (PS) were evaluated, and a COPD Assessment Test (CAT) was completed.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, chemokine expression patterns in the systemic and genital tract compartments are associated with HIV-1 infection in women from Benin. In a study conducted in Cotonou, Benin, levels of both genital mucosal and blood chemokines were compared between HIV-1-uninfected and HIV-1-infected female commercial sex workers (CSWs) as well as HIV-1-uninfected non-CSW control women at low risk for exposure. Thirty-nine HIV-1-infected women had blood, cervicovaginal lavage, and biopsies of the uterine cervix taken quarterly for up to 5 years. Cytokines/chemokines were quantified by Luminex assay in cervicovaginal lavage, and cellular phenotypes were characterized using immunohistochemistry in cervical biopsies. Comparisons of cytokine/chemokine concentrations and the percent of tissue staining positive for T cells were compared using generalized estimating equations between non-shedding and shedding visits across all women and within a subgroup of women who intermittently shed HIV-1.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the pathological observation of lung injury in experimental animals induced by non-ferrous metal ( tin ) dust was conducted in the study. The study found that on the 30th day after exposure to tin dusts, the scattered hoar tip size of the spots in surface and section of the lungs were observed, the scattered focal granulomatous inflammation around the small bronchi and dust particles in lung tissue were observed under microscope. On the 90th day after exposure to tin dusts, the granulomatous inflammation increase, the fibroblasts proliferation, collagen fibers formation and positive VG staining were found. These pathological changes were basically the characters of specific pathological changes in early tin pneumoconiosis.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the DNA methylation of the retinoid acid receptor beta (RARbeta), cellular retinol-binding protein 1 (CRBP1), and tazarotene-induced gene 1 (TIG1) genes is associated with gastric carcinoma (GC) and their expression is linked with DNA methylation. In this study, the authors analyzed the DNA methylation status of these genes in 42 samples of GC from 42 patients and in 8 GC cell lines by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. The mRNA expression levels for these three genes were measured by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. The results showed that in 7 of 8 GC cell lines, the CRBP1 gene was hypermethylated, and CRBP1 transcription was inactive. In 6 of 8 GC cell lines, the TIG1 gene was hypermethylated, and TIG1 transcription was inactive. Treatment with demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restored both CRBP1 and TIG1 transcription. DNA methylation of the RARbeta, CRBP1, and TIG1 genes was detected in 15 of 42 GC samples (36%), 14 of 42 GC",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, antiangiogenic therapy of cerebral melanoma metastases does not result in sustained tumor progression via vessel co-option. The context indicates that the PI3K-AKT survival pathway is hyperactivated in brain but not extracerebral melanoma metastases and that astrocyte-conditioned medium activates AKT in melanoma cells in vitro. Additionally, the context mentions that the role of plasminogen in the ability of human melanoma cells to cross a human blood-brain barrier model was studied on a transwell system. However, it does not mention anything about antiangiogenic therapy of cerebral melanoma metastases resulting in sustained tumor progression via vessel co-option.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, clove and eugenol in noncytotoxic concentrations exert immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory action on cytokine production by murine macrophages. Clove (100\u00b5g/well) inhibited interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-10 production and exerted an efficient action either before or after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge for all cytokines. Eugenol did not affect IL-1\u03b2 production but inhibited IL-6 and IL-10 production. The action of eugenol (50 or 100\u00b5g/well) on IL-6 production prevented efficiently effects of LPS either before or after its addition, whereas on IL-10 production it counteracted significantly LPS action when added after LPS incubation.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, pretreatment with stellate ganglion blockade before ischemia does not reduce infarct size in rat hearts. The study found that there was no significant difference in infarct size between the SGB group (rats with percutaneous ganglion blockade) and the control group (rats that were injected with normal saline).",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, lipidomics reveals multiple pathway effects of a multi-components preparation on lipid biochemistry in ApoE*3Leiden.CETP mice. The preparation SUB885C caused significant reductions in plasma cholesterol, CETP levels, CETP activity, and increased HDL-C. It influenced lipidomics classes of cholesterol esters and triglycerides the most. In vitro, SUB885C extract caused adipolysis stimulation and adipogenesis inhibition in 3T3-L1 cells.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, elevated nm23 protein expression is not correlated with diminished progression-free survival in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma. The study found that elevated nm23 protein expression is associated with disease progression, but not with progression-free survival.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, leukotriene B ( 4 ) does not enhance tumour necrosis factor-alpha-induced CCL27 production in human keratinocytes. The study only investigated the in vitro effects of LTB(4) on CCL27 production in human keratinocytes and found no effect on CCL27 production.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, hemoglobin levels do not predict biochemical outcome for localized prostate cancer treated with neoadjuvant androgen-suppression therapy and external-beam radiotherapy.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) can impair insulin-mediated glucose uptake and disposition in the liver. This is supported by the finding that NEFA suppression during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was decreased in individuals with severe fatty liver, and the insulin sensitivity index for NEFA was decreased in all three groups with fatty liver. Additionally, the study found that NEFA concentrations were associated with fatty liver independently of whole-body glucose production and disposal measurements.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, induction of oral tolerance to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) attenuated the initiation and progression of atherogenesis in LDL receptor-/- mice fed a Western-type diet. This was shown through a significant increase in CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ cells in spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes, which specifically responded to oxLDL with increased transforming growth factor-beta production. Additionally, tolerance to oxLDL increased the mRNA expression of Foxp3, CTLA-4, and CD25 in the plaque. However, tolerance to malondialdehyde-treated LDL (MDA-LDL) did not affect atherogenesis.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the study found that women with type 1 diabetes and insulin resistance have a more atherogenic lipoprotein subfraction cholesterol distribution.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, options in pediatric glaucoma after angle surgery have failed.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the present study tested the hypothesis that rosuvastatin treatment may attenuate left ventricular (LV) remodelling and dysfunction in the failing heart, which may be associated with alterations of Ca(2+)-regulatory protein. The study found that rosuvastatin prevented LV remodelling and dysfunction by preventing the decrease of SERCA2a and pSer16-PLB expression, increasing SERCA activity, and reducing the increased IL-6 level and further elevated IL-10 level in the peri-infarct and remote zones of MI. Superoxide dismutase activity in the rosuvastatin-treated group was higher than that of the control group; serum levels of malondialdehyde were lower. BNP and hs-CRP levels in the rosuvastatin-treated group were lower than that of the control group. Four weeks after PCI, the left ventricular ejection fraction in the treatment group was higher than that of the control group, and the left ventricular end-diastolic volume was lower. At the 6-month follow-up, there was no difference in major adverse cardiac events between the 2 groups.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, prolonged resuscitation of metabolic acidosis after trauma is associated with more complications. According to the study, morbidly obese patients with persistent metabolic acidosis developed MOF at a significantly greater rate than did normal weight patients with or without persistent metabolic acidosis. Additionally, in patients with successful resuscitation and controlled ICP, within 72 h of trauma, 76% had low glucose, 93% had elevated LPR, and 74% were in metabolic crisis. The duration of metabolic crisis was longer in those patients with unfavorable (GOSe \u2264 6) versus favorable (GOSe \u2265 7) outcome at 6 months (P = 0.011). In four multivariate models, the burden of metabolic crisis was a powerful independent predictor of poor outcome.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, nSC23925 has been shown to prevent the development of multidrug resistance in osteosarcoma cells in vitro. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of nSC23925 on the prevention of multidrug resistance in ovarian cancer, especially in vivo.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, restoration of klotho expression induces apoptosis and autophagy in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study evaluated the total white blood cell (WBC) counts of all patients with severe preeclampsia with and without HELLP syndrome admitted to the hospital between 1995 and 1997. The patients were grouped by diagnosis and timing of platelet nadir. Analysis of variance and regression analysis were used for data analysis. The study found that the WBC counts were significantly higher in patients with HELLP syndrome (12.5 +/-.442 x 10(9)/L) than in patients with severe preeclampsia (10.3 +/-.288 x 10(9)/L). Regression analysis showed that platelet counts varied inversely with WBC counts. Additionally, patients with class I HELLP syndrome had significantly higher WBC counts than patients with other classes of HELLP syndrome. The study also found that the leukocytes of healthy pregnant women differed substantially and significantly from those of nonpregnant women, with increased CD11b, CD14, and CD64 and increased intracellular reactive oxygen species. In preeclampsia, there was, in addition to these changes, reduced expression of L-selectin and further increases in intracellular reactive oxygen species. The changes found in normal pregnancy and preeclampsia were similar,",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, decoy receptor 3 ( DcR3 ) overexpression predicts the prognosis and pN2 in pancreatic head carcinoma. High DcR3 expression was associated with high-grade and high-stage RCCs. The incidence of distant metastasis and lymph node metastasis was significantly higher in the group with high DcR3 expression. Decoy receptor 3 expression correlated negatively with disease-specific survival and progression-free survival in univariate analyses. A multivariate Cox regression analysis retained DcR3 expression as an independent prognostic factor that outperformed the Karnofsky performance status. In patients with high-stage RCCs expressing DcR3, the 2-year survival probability was 25%, whereas in patients with DcR3-negative tumors, the survival probability was 65% (P <.001).",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, a Multi-Component Prime-Boost Vaccination Regimen with a Consensus MOMP Antigen enhances Chlamydia trachomatis Clearance. The DNA-HuAd5-MVA-Protein vaccine regimen induced a cellular response with a Th1-biased serum antibody response, alongside high serum and vaginal MOMP-specific antibodies. This regimen significantly enhanced clearance against intravaginal C. trachomatis serovar D infection in both BALB/c and B6C3F1 mouse strains. This enhanced clearance was shown to be CD4(+) T-cell dependent.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study investigates the role of the novel selective angiotensin II type 2 receptor agonist, Compound 21 (C21) in an experimental model of diabetes-associated atherosclerosis (DAA). However, the answer to whether C21 is protective in DAA is not provided in the given context.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, fitness and adiposity are independently associated with cardiometabolic risk in youth.\n\nExplanation: The provided context mentions that the study examined the independent associations of muscle fitness and cardiorespiratory fitness with clustered metabolic risk in youth. It also mentions that few studies have investigated the association between maximal cardiorespiratory capacity (fitness) and the clustered cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in children and youth from culturally diverse countries. This suggests that fitness and adiposity are independently associated with cardiometabolic risk in youth.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, patient-prosthesis mismatch in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement can affect survival. An independent detrimental effect of prosthesis-patient mismatch on survival was observed in patients with aortic stenosis/mixed disease who had preoperative left ventricular dysfunction. In these patients, prosthesis-patient mismatch predicted heart failure symptoms by 3 years after aortic valve replacement. However, there was no such effect in patients with aortic insufficiency.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, a high frequency of competitive sports early in life is associated with greater bone mineral density (BMD) at several bone sites, indicating that increases in BMD following physical activity (PA) are preserved longer than previously believed. Additionally, lifetime sport and leisure activity participation during adolescence and adulthood is associated with greater bone size, quality and strength in older men. This is based on a population-based study of 75-year-old men (n = 498) that used dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to assess hip, spine and ultradistal (UD) radius areal bone mineral density (aBMD), quantitative ultrasound (QUS) to measure heel bone quality, and quantitative computed tomography (QCT) to assess volumetric BMD, bone geometry and strength at the spine and mid-femur. The study also calculated the total time (min) spent participating in sport and leisure activities and an osteogenic index (OI) score for each participant, which provides a measure of participation in weight-bearing activities.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, hemizygous deletion of CTGF/CCN2 does not suffice to prevent fibrosis of the severely injured kidney. The study examined the effects of CCN2 haploinsufficiency on the progression of renal scarring in long-term STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy, in a more advanced stage of obstructive nephropathy following unilateral ureteric obstruction (UUO), and in severe aristolochic acid (AA)-induced tubulotoxic nephritis, and found that CCN2 haploinsufficiency did not prevent fibrosis in any of these models.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the study found that severity of hepatic encephalopathy before orthotopic liver transplantation correlated with quality of life after transplantation.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, sutureless securement device StatLock has been shown to reduce catheter-related complications when compared to tape in earlier studies. In a study of 170 patients requiring PICCs, which were randomized to suture or StatLock securement, statistically significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of catheter-related complications including dislodgment, infection, occlusion, leakage, and central venous thrombosis. Therefore, sutureless securement device StatLock offers an advantage over suture in preventing catheter-related complications.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, attachment of synovial fibroblasts (SFs) to laminin-111 facilitates transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta)-induced expression of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) in SFs. Incubation of SFs on laminin-111 in the presence of TGFbeta induced a significant 12-fold higher expression of MMP-3 mRNA, and secretion of MMP-3 was elevated 20-fold above controls.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, functional health literacy is associated with health status and health-related knowledge in people living with HIV-AIDS. A study conducted on a community-recruited sample of 339 HIV-infected men and women found that patients with inadequate health literacy had lower HIV/AIDS knowledge scores compared to those with marginal or adequate health literacy. Additionally, the study found that patients' REALM scores, which assess functional health literacy, were positively associated with patients' HIV/AIDS knowledge even after adjusting for income, education, and risk perception.",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, computer-assisted instruction (CAI) tutorial program can improve clinical reasoning skills of dietetics students. The effects of a CAI tutorial program on learning clinical reasoning skills were compared in undergraduate dietetics students. Scores on the simulation test were compared and variables included type of CAI, dietetics program, year in school, computer experience, and experience using a medical chart. Mastery of objectives related to lower- and higher-level clinical reasoning skills introduced in the tutorial program was computed.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, soy protein isolates of varied isoflavone content can influence serum thyroid hormones in healthy young men. The study found that consumption of high-isoflavone soy protein isolate (61.7 +/- 7.4 mg iso/day) significantly decreased total triiodothyronine (T3) and free T3 levels, while increasing total thyroxine (T4) and free T4 levels, compared to low-isoflavone soy protein isolate (1.64 +/- 0.19 mg iso/day) and milk protein isolate (MPI) in a randomized crossover design.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, immunity to blood stages of P. falciparum is dependent on a specific pattern of immunoglobulin subclass responses to multiple blood stage antigens. This is supported by previous studies showing that IgG1 and IgG3 responses against antigens like ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigens, merozoite surface proteins and variant surface antigens on schizonts were associated with clinical immunity against malaria.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the reanalysis of recombination patterns of some HIV-1 circulating recombination forms (CRFs) suggests the necessity and difficulty of revision. The current study was based on multiple recombination analysis, which may have produced more impartial results. The study found that revisions may be necessary for other CRFs. The Simplot v.3.5.1 program was used to verify intragenic recombination, and SplitsTree 4.0 was employed to confirm the phylogenetic relationship of the BF1 recombinant samples.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, osteopontin (OPN) is the most highly upregulated factor early after neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Therefore, it is likely that OPN plays a role in endogenous repair after neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, xenon pretreatment attenuates anesthetic-induced apoptosis in the developing brain in comparison with nitrous oxide and hypoxia.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, p130 does not mediate TGF-beta-induced cell-cycle arrest in Rb mutant HT-3 cells. Instead, E2F-4 is the protein that binds to p130 and causes the downregulation of E2F-1, which leads to the growth inhibition of HT-3 cells.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, past cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3, obesity, and earlier menopause are associated with an increased risk of vulval cancer in postmenopausal women.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, degree of coronary stenosis is correlated to cerebrovascular reactivity, but severity of coronary artery disease is not.",

    "\n\nAnswer: No, high doses of EDU were not toxic to the fast-growing willow species and did not affect the C content and distribution within the plant body. However, EDU did increase the leaf N content. Additionally, there was no EDU persistence in the soil, as indicated by soil N content.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, high maternal body mass index increases the risk of neonatal early onset group B streptococcal disease. In obese parturients with BMI > 30, there was an 80% increased risk for verified neonatal EOGBS disease. When cases with clinical sepsis were included, a significant risk increment was also found in overweight women with BMI 25.0-29.9.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The provided context does mention caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) and its potential to increase radiosensitivity in lung cancer, but it does not specifically mention its effects on acute pneumonitis after irradiation in vitro and in vivo.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study assessed the effects of early thymoglobulin administration on cardiocyte nuclear status in orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) recipients. The study investigated endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs) from 31 OHT recipients and 10 control cases. OHT patients were divided into the standard group who were treated without thymoglobulin; an ATG group who received thymoglobulin electively, and a standard+ATG group who were administered thymoglobulin upon a drop in renal function. The study evaluated only EMBs obtained at 1 and 4 weeks after OHT showing no significant rejection (ISHLT grades 0 to 1B). The morphometric studies were performed using a computerized, automated Quantimet image analysis system. The study quantitated 1750 cardiocyte nuclei for area, length, breadth, perimeter, chromatin median grey level, and fullness factor. The study found no significant difference in the morphometric parameters between the standard group and the ATG group. Therefore, the study did not find that thymoglobulin administered early after heart transplantation reduces early myocardial hypertrophy assessed by morphometric studies.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, dNA-PKcs expression was found to be a predictor of biochemical recurrence after permanent Iodine 125 interstitial brachytherapy for prostate cancer. In the study, positive dNA-PKcs nuclear staining was closely associated with biochemical recurrence (P=.003) and remained predictive of recurrence on multivariate analysis (P=.03).",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, chemotherapy for cancer can cause apoptosis that precedes hypoplasia in crypts of the small intestine in humans. The document states that apoptosis increased sevenfold in intestinal crypts at one day, and villus area, crypt length, mitotic count per crypt, and enterocyte height decreased at three days after chemotherapy. This indicates that chemotherapy can cause apoptosis in the small intestine, which can lead to hypoplasia in the crypts.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, alveolar macrophage gene expression is altered in the setting of alcohol use disorders. Whole genome microarray analysis was performed on alveolar macrophages obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage from a test cohort of subjects with AUDs and controls who were pair-matched on age, gender, and smoking. Probe set expression differences in this cohort were validated by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT RT-PCR). Functional analysis with web-based bioinformatics tools was utilized with microarray data to assess differentially expressed candidate genes (p < 0.01) based on alcohol consumption. Alveolar macrophage mRNA samples from a second cohort of subjects with AUDs and controls were used to confirm gene expression differences related to AUDs.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, a diminished postnatal surge of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants is not additional evidence for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The study found that the number of Ad spermatogonia in unilateral cryptorchid testes correlated in a nonlinear fashion with those in the contralateral scrotal testes, indicating that the development of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants is similar to that in the control population. The study also found that the total number of germ cells in the cryptorchid testes in the first six months of life is normal, after which it declines rapidly. This suggests that the development of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants is not affected by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, gender and household food insecurity are associated with stunting among young Pakistani children residing in urban squatter settlements. Female children were nearly three times more likely to be stunted than male children. Households that were food insecure with hunger were also three times more likely than other households to have a stunted child.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, combination therapy with VELCADE and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is neuroprotective in aged rats after stroke and targets microRNA-146a and the toll-like receptor signaling pathway. The study found that combination treatment with VELCADE and tPA modulates the TLR signaling pathway on cerebral vasculature, which leads to neuroprotection in aged rats after stroke. The study also found that the combination treatment increased miR-l46a levels, which was inversely associated with the reduction of vascular interleukin-1 receptor-activated kinases 1 immunoreactivity. In vitro, fibrin upregulated interleukin-1 receptor-activated kinases 1 and TLR4 expression and downregulated miR-146a on primary human cerebral endothelial cells. VELCADE elevated miR-146 levels and abolished fibrin-increased interleukin-1 receptor activated kinases 1 proteins.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the study found that higher peak weight velocity (PWV) in infancy was associated with impaired lung function indices at 15 years of age.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, the provided context does not mention anything about garlic-derived S-allylmercaptocysteine being a hepato-protective agent in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in vivo animal model.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the study found that an increasing proportion of time spent performing chest compressions during cardiac arrest was associated with a higher likelihood of survival to hospital discharge in patients with out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation. The study found that patients in the highest category of chest compression fraction had a 3.01 times higher odds of surviving to hospital discharge compared to the reference category.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, expression of snail in pancreatic cancer promotes metastasis and chemoresistance.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, slug down-regulation by RNA interference inhibits invasion growth in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. This was demonstrated in a study that utilized RNA interference to knockdown Slug gene expression and evaluated the effects on survival and invasive carcinoma using a Boyden chamber transwell assay in vitro. The study also evaluated the effect of Slug siRNA-transfection and Slug cDNA-transfection on E-cadherin and Bcl-2 expression in ESCC cells.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The provided context does not mention postoperative CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil) or its potential to ameliorate poor outcomes in women with residual invasive breast cancer after neoadjuvant epirubicin/docetaxel chemotherapy. The context discusses neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and its potential role in early-stage breast cancer, as well as postneoadjuvant chemotherapy after taxane-containing NACT. It also mentions a retrospective study comparing overall survival, disease-free survival, and local recurrence-free survival in women with pathologic complete response (pCR) and persistent in situ disease (pCR+DCIS) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. However, it does not mention postoperative CMF or its potential impact on outcomes.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The WD40 domain is required for LRRK2 neurotoxicity. Loss of the WD40 domain completely blocks the neurotoxicity of multiple LRRK2 PD mutations.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the hypothesis that inhibition of leukocyte function by administration of monoclonal antibody 60.3 (MoAb 60.3) improves electrophysiological recovery and decreases injury volume following transient focal cerebral ischemia in cats is supported by the results of the study.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, prenatal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure affects maternal behavior and male offspring sexual behavior in adulthood. In the study, pregnant rats injected with LPS on gestation day 21 showed reduced maternal behavior, decreased general activity, a smaller body weight difference between GD21 and PND1, a greater number of perinatal deaths, and smaller litters. For the male pups, LPS treatment resulted in a decreased body weight on PND2, whereas the anogenital distance and the day of testis descent were not modified. The male sexual behavior was impaired by prenatal LPS. Particularly the number of ejaculating animals was reduced. The testis weight was also lower in the prenatally LPS-treated rats than in the control rats.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (AFABP) levels are significantly elevated in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) versus control and correlate with indices of adiposity. AFABP also correlates with indices of subcutaneous rather than visceral fat.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, timing variability during gait initiation is increased in people with Alzheimer's disease compared to controls.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, pitching biomechanics as a pitcher approach muscular fatigue during a simulated baseball game. Compared with the initial 2 innings, as a pitcher approached muscular fatigue during the final 2 innings, there was a significant decrease in ball velocity, and the trunk was significantly closer to a vertical position. There were no other significant differences in kinematics or kinetics variables.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the bisphosphonate Pamidronate has been shown to be an intestinal antiinflammatory agent in rat and mouse experimental colitis. In rats, pretreatment with Pamidronate improves chemically induced trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid and dextran sulfate sodium colitis. This beneficial effect is extended to lymphocyte transfer colitis. Pamidronate has no effect on intestinal epithelial cells in vitro in terms of cytokine/chemokine release, but enhances IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, and IL-10 production by T cells in coculture. Pamidronate also exerts a direct immunomodulatory effect on T cells, favoring Th1 differentiation and impairing Th17 polarization.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, the provided context does not mention any study or research that specifically investigates the effect of bilateral cochlear implants on sound localization acuity in children.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The provided context does not mention anything about gM-CSF contributing to the healing of ecthyma gangrenosum lesions in kidney transplant recipients. The context discusses the role of gM-CSF in wound healing in diabetic mice and its beneficial effects on colitis in mice.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, pterygium is related to a decrease in corneal endothelial cell density. A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted on 90 consecutive patients with unilateral primary pterygium, and the results showed that there was a significant decrease in corneal endothelial cell density in the eyes with pterygium compared to the fellow eyes, which were considered as controls. Additionally, an increase in astigmatism in eyes with pterygium was evaluated for association with decreased ECD using the Pearson correlation test.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, long-term reversal of hypocholesterolaemia in patients with chronic hepatitis C is related to sustained viral response and viral genotype. In patients with genotype-3 of HCV and sustained viral response, serum cholesterol increased from 138 (95% CI: 120-151) to 180 mg/dL (95% CI: 171-199) 12 months after treatment conclusion (P < 0.0001). By contrast, cholesterol values were unchanged in genotype-3 of HCV non-responders and in patients with genotype-1 of HCV regardless of response. This suggests that the reversal of hypocholesterolaemia in patients with chronic hepatitis C is related to the sustained viral response and viral genotype.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study aimed to see if life style interventions/weight reduction could decrease cathepsin L and S levels in blood plasma. However, the provided context does not mention any association between life style interventions and decreased levels of cathepsins L and S in plasma. It only mentions that higher cathepsin S was associated with higher CRP and IL-6 after 7 yr.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, the provided context does not mention any association between a novel polymorphism of the CYP19 gene and essential hypertension in China. The context discusses the association between a polymorphism of the CYP11B2 gene and hypertension in the Chinese population, but not the CYP19 gene.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, different alternative splicing patterns - simple and complex ASEs - may be subject to opposite selection forces for protein reading frame preservation. Simple ASEs have higher frequency of reading frame preservation (FRFP) than constitutively spliced exons (CSEs), while complex ASEs have lower FRFP than CSEs. Conservation of the ASE/CSE splicing pattern increases the FRFPs of simple ASEs but decreases those of complex ASEs. Contrary to the well-recognized concept of strong selection pressure on conserved ASEs for protein reading frame preservation, our results show that conserved complex ASEs are relaxed from such pressure and the frame-disrupting effect caused by the insertion of complex ASEs can be offset by compensatory changes in their flanking exons.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, high nuclear expression of HDGF correlates with disease progression and poor prognosis in human endometrial carcinoma. The study found that patients with increased HDGF expression levels had poorer overall survival rates than those with low expression of HDGF levels. Additionally, the study found that higher expression of nuclear HDGF was associated significantly with T stage and clinical stage, but there was no association with lymph node or distant metastasis.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The provided context does not mention any comparison between the initial assessment and follow-up of patients with Erdheim-Chester disease using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scanning. However, it does mention that whole-body scanning with 18F-FDG-PET was used in a large cohort of ECD patients from a single center to assess the value of this imaging technique. Additionally, the study group comprised 43 presymptomatic (preHD) subjects carrying the HD mutation who underwent a 18F-FDG PET scan and were prospectively followed-up for at least 5 years using the unified HD rating scale to detect clinical changes. Multiple regression analysis included subject's age, CAG mutation size and glucose uptake as variables in a model to predict age at onset. Therefore, it can be concluded that 18F-FDG-PET scanning is useful in both the initial assessment and follow-up of patients with Erdheim-Chester disease.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) was significantly higher in tumor tissues of human head and neck, skin, prostate, and pancreatic tumor samples than that in the adjacent normal tissues.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the study shows that a genetic deletion of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (Mmp-9) reverses ERP habituation deficits in Fmr1 KO mice. Although the N1 amplitude of Mmp-9/Fmr1 DKO recordings was larger than WT and KO recordings, the habituation of ERPs in Mmp-9/Fmr1 DKO mice is similar to WT mice, implicating MMP-9 as a potential target for reversing sensory processing deficits in FXS.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, air quality influences the prevalence of hay fever and sinusitis. The study found a statistically significant relationship between air quality and the prevalence of hay fever and sinusitis. The standardized regression coefficient for hay fever and sinusitis were substantially larger than the coefficient for the control condition of kidney failure/weakening.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, s 23521 decreases food intake and body weight gain in diet-induced obese rats. The treatment significantly reduced cumulative energy intake, body weight gain, adiposity, and plasma triglyceride levels.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study found that there were age-dependent differences in regional expression of NMDAR subunits and markers of glutamatergic, GABAergic, and monoaminergic systems in mice infected with T. gondii. In addition, there was a significantly greater elevation of GLUN2 autoantibodies in juvenile-compared to adult-infected mice. However, the study did not directly evaluate the relationship between anti-NMDA receptor autoantibodies and associated neurobehavioral pathology in mice dependent on age of first exposure to T. gondii.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Based on the information provided, it appears that risedronate gastrointestinal absorption is not independent of site and rate of administration. In study A, no statistically significant site-specific differences in any pharmacokinetic parameter were observed, suggesting that the absorption of risedronate is similar regardless of the gastrointestinal site. Additionally, in study B, the extent of risedronate absorption did not differ significantly following a rapid or a slow infusion, indicating that the rate of administration does not significantly affect absorption. However, it is important to note that these studies were conducted in healthy male subjects and may not be generalizable to other populations.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, the study does not provide evidence that neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin protects renal tubular epithelial cells in hypoxia-reperfusion by reducing apoptosis. The study aims to elucidate the role of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin in regulating apoptosis of tubular epithelial cells in a hypoxia-reperfusion model, but it does not provide evidence that neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin protects these cells.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, high body mass index (BMI) is associated with increased diurnal strains in the articular cartilage of the knee. Subjects with high BMI had significantly thicker cartilage on both the patella and femoral groove, as compared to subjects with normal BMI. Diurnal cartilage strains were dependent on location in the knee joint, as well as BMI. Subjects with high BMI, compared to those with normal BMI, exhibited significantly higher compressive strains in the tibial cartilage. However, there was no significant effect of BMI on diurnal cartilage strain in the femur.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The present study investigated the biochemical mechanisms of electroacupuncture (EA) anti-inflammation in a rat model. Experiment 1 measured plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels to see if EA regulates CORT secretion. The results showed that EA treatment significantly decreased plasma CORT levels compared to the control group. Therefore, it can be concluded that corticosterone does not mediate electroacupuncture-produced anti-edema in a rat model of inflammation.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, soluble oncoprotein 185HER-2 in pleural fluid has limited usefulness for the diagnostic evaluation of malignant effusions.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, the study did not investigate the effects of Bevacizumab on mitochondria isolated from human brain tumors. The study only investigated the direct effects of Temozolomide and Bevacizumab on the function of mitochondria and compared these effects on mitochondria isolated from low- and high-grade human brain tumors.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study found no difference in diuresis, urine osmolality, or aquaporin-2 excretion between genders. However, there was a trend towards a higher reabsorption of free water in males. The excretion of prostaglandin E2 was higher in males. There was no diurnal rhythm in p-oxytocin and no correlation to diuresis, urine osmolality, or aquaporin-2 excretions. Therefore, urinary concentration does not exclusively rely on plasma vasopressin.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, plasma levels of angiostatin and endostatin are elevated for 2-4 weeks after colorectal cancer surgery.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, adherence to the 2006 American Heart Association Diet and Lifestyle Recommendations (AHA-DLR) is not associated with bone health in older Puerto Ricans. The study tested the hypothesis that adherence to the AHA-DLR is associated with bone health, but the results showed no significant association. The study used dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry to measure bone mineral density (BMD) at the femoral neck, trochanter, total hip, and lumbar spine (L2-L4) in 933 Puerto Ricans aged 47-79 y. However, the study did not find any association between adherence to the AHA-DLR and bone health.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, basophils are recruited to inflamed lungs in mice and humans. Adoptive transfer of basophils to OVA-sensitized hosts enhanced lung IL-4 and IL-13 release, while co-administration of OVA further aggravated airway inflammation and Th2 responses in LNs. In vitro studies revealed that pulmonary basophils interacted with lung CD4 effectors to increase T cell survival and Th2 cytokine expression at the single cell level, and amplified OVA-loaded DC-driven Th2 differentiation. Additionally, human basophils augmented in vitro IL-4 expression in effector memory CD4 T cells that include CRTH2(+) cells through IL-4 and TCR-independent pathways. However, the impact of basophils on the function of tissue CD4 effector T cells remains unknown.",

    "\n\nAnswer: No indication of impairment to the haematological indices measured, hepatic function, or muscle damage was apparent after Cr supplementation. In contrast to previous reports, no detrimental effects of creatine supplementation on the renal function indices were observed in two-thirds nephrectomized or sham-operated animals. No differences were observed in inulin (0.28+/-0.08 vs 0.25+/-0.08 ml/min/100 g; P=NS) or creatinine clearance rates. Serum cystatin C concentration, urinary protein excretion, and albumin and urea clearance were comparable between creatine-supplemented and control-diet fed animals in both sham-operated and two-thirds nephrectomized animals.",

Additionally, clozapine treatment also improves synaptic plasticity of the STOP null animals by restoring long-term potentiation in the hippocampus.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study was designed to clarify whether the association between chlamydia pneumoniae and atherosclerotic disease is based on C pneumoniae-induced transformation of a stable into an unstable atherosclerotic plaque or on stimulation of hypercoagulability leading to increased thrombotic arterial occlusions by C pneumoniae infection. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonographic monitoring of the middle cerebral artery during carotid endarterectomy offers the opportunity to study, before removal of the plaque, atherothrombotic emboli dislodging from an unstable carotid plaque (plaque-related emboli) and emboli related to (excessive) thrombus formation at the endarterectomy site after removal of the plaque and restoration of flow (thrombosis-related emboli).",

We also report an abnormally high level of matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) in the auditory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice and that deletion of Mmp-9 from Fmr1 KO mice reverses habituation deficits. These data provide a translation relevant electrophysiological biomarker for sensory deficits in FXS and implicate MMP-9 as a target for drug discovery.",

      "Measurement of pleural fluid sp185(HER-2) has poor diagnostic performance in patients with malignant effusions.",
      "TMZ and BEV can directly cause the dysfunction of mitochondria isolated from human brain tumors. However, BEV has a greater ability to disturb mitochondrial function in mitochondria isolated from human brain tumors than either TMZ or calcium overload conditions.",
      "Similar urinary flows and osmolalities are associated with levels of plasma vasopressin and renal PGE2, which are higher in males than in females. Oxytocin does not seem to play a role in the diurnal urine formation, whereas prostaglandin E2 could represent a mediator of the gender difference, not only as a mediator of the vasopressin response, but also as an independent factor. These findings need further elucidation.",
      "MICR has a very transient impact on plasma levels of endostatin and no impact on angiostatin during the first 21 days following surgery. Thus, angiostatin and endostatin do not likely contribute to or inhibit the persistent proangiogenic changes noted after MICR.",
      "Dietary guidelines for CVD risk reduction may also benefit bone health in this Hispanic cohort. Synchronizing dietary guidelines for these 2 common diseases may provide a simplified public health message. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01231958.",
      "Basophils may worsen Th2 inflammatory disorders through direct interactions with pathogenic CD4 T cells as well as by enhancing DC-induced Th2 cell development.",
      "We conclude that inhibition of TLR4 with eritoran in an in situ murine model significantly reduces MI/R injury and markers of an inflammatory response.",
      "HMbeta supplementation can increase survival time and promotes metabolic changes in cancer-bearing animals, but it seems to work in a time-dependent manner.",
      "The probability of a successful cardioversion correlates inversely with NT-proBNP values. The short-term success of a cardioversion might be predicted by prior determination of NT-proBNP.",
      "These data provide evidence that there are no obvious adverse effects of acute or more chronic Cr supplementation on the haematological indices measured, nor on hepatic, muscle, and renal function. Therefore there is no apparent health risk associated with Cr supplementation to healthy people when it is ingested in quantities that have been scientifically proven to increase muscle Cr stores.",
      "Our data provide strong evidence that both cAMP effectors, Epac and PKA, and the levels of intracellular calcium are involved in the hepatic cystogenesis of ARPKD.",
      "All together, the pharmacological reactivity of STOP null mice to antipsychotics evokes the pharmacological response of humans to such drugs. Totally, our study suggests that STOP null mice may provide a useful preclinical model to evaluate pharmacological properties of antipsychotic drugs.",
      "This study confirms that C pneumoniae is a common finding in atherosclerotic plaques of the carotid artery but suggests that the presence of the infectious organism has little detectable impact on plaque instability when measured by clinically significant markers. This raises important questions for the rationale of antibiotic therapy in atherosclerosis.",
      "Moxibustion exerted its effect on healing impaired colonic mucosa in rats with TNBS-induced colitis by increasing the degranulation ratio of local MC, but had little effect on the morphology of MC at ST25 acupoint.",
      "Laser Doppler flowmetry detected circulatory abnormalities in primary open-angle glaucoma suspects who did not have any manifest visual field defect. Decreases in flow in glaucoma suspects were similar in magnitude to those of subjects with primary open-angle glaucoma. These data suggest that impaired optic nerve blood flow develops early in the glaucomatous process and does not develop solely as a result of glaucoma damage."
