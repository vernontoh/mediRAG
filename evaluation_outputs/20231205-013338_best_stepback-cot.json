    "\n\nAnswer: Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is characterized by dynamic impairment of active relaxation and contraction of the left ventricle on exercise. However, the association between HFpEF and myocardial energy deficiency is not clear.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, soluble ( Pro ) Renin Receptor is a predictor of gestational diabetes mellitus. The study found that soluble ( Pro ) Renin Receptor levels were positively associated with serum Cr, BUN, UA levels, CKD stage, and urine protein/Cr ratio, and inversely with estimated glomerular infiltration rate and Hb. Additionally, soluble ( Pro ) Renin Receptor levels were inversely associated with \u03b1-Klotho levels but did not correlate with prorenin levels. With respect to antihypertensive drugs, soluble ( Pro ) Renin Receptor levels were significantly lower in patients treated with an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) than in those without ARB therapy. Soluble ( Pro ) Renin Receptor levels were significantly lower in CKD patients with diabetes mellitus or primary hypertension than in those without these conditions. In contrast, serum levels of prorenin did not correlate with parameters related to renal function.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, obvious emphysema on computed tomography during an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is associated with a poor prognosis.",
    "\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe study compared levels of both genital mucosal and blood chemokines between HIV-1-uninfected and HIV-1-infected female commercial sex workers (CSWs) as well as HIV-1-uninfected non-CSW control women at low risk for exposure, recruited in Cotonou, Benin. The study found that chemokine expression patterns in the systemic and genital tract compartments were associated with HIV-1 infection in women from Benin. However, the specific chemokines that were found to be associated with HIV-1 infection were not mentioned in the provided context.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the pathological observation of lung injury in experimental animals induced by non-ferrous metal ( tin ) dust was observed in rats exposed to tin dusts. On the 30th day after exposure to tin dusts, the scattered hoar tip size of the spots in surface and section of the lungs were observed, the scattered focal granulomatous inflammation around the small bronchi and dust particles in lung tissue were observed under microscope. On the 90th day after exposure to tin dusts, the granulomatous inflammation increase, the fibroblasts proliferation, collagen fibers formation and positive VG staining were found. These pathological changes were basically the characters of specific pathological changes in early tin pneumoconiosis.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the DNA methylation of the retinoid acid receptor beta (RARbeta), cellular retinol-binding protein 1 (CRBP1), and tazarotene-induced gene 1 (TIG1) genes is associated with retinoic acid signaling in gastric carcinoma (GC).",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, antiangiogenic therapy of cerebral melanoma metastases does not result in sustained tumor progression via vessel co-option. The study showed that the PI3K-AKT survival pathway is hyperactivated in brain but not extracerebral melanoma metastases and that astrocyte-conditioned medium activates AKT in melanoma cells in vitro. The PI3K inhibitor buparlisib was tested as an antitumor agent for melanoma brain metastases and it was found to be effective in treating cerebral melanoma metastases.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, clove and eugenol in noncytotoxic concentrations exert immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory action on cytokine production by murine macrophages. Clove (100\u00b5g/well) inhibited IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-10 production and exerted an efficient action either before or after LPS challenge for all cytokines. Eugenol did not affect IL-1\u03b2 production but inhibited IL-6 and IL-10 production. The action of eugenol (50 or 100\u00b5g/well) on IL-6 production prevented efficiently effects of LPS either before or after its addition, whereas on IL-10 production it counteracted significantly LPS action when added after LPS incubation.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, pretreatment with stellate ganglion blockade before ischemia reduced infarct size in rat hearts.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, lipidomics reveals multiple pathway effects of a multi-components preparation on lipid biochemistry in ApoE*3Leiden.CETP mice. According to the factor analysis of the lipidomic profile, several species of lipids were found to be correlated with different phenotypes, including diabetes-related C23:2CE, C23:3CE, C23:4CE, ePE36:4, ePE36:5, ePE36:6; race-related (African-American) PI36:1; and sex-related PE34:1 and LPC18:2. The major variance of gene expression profile was not caused by known factors and no significant difference can be directly derived from differential gene expression profile. However, the combination of lipidomic and gene expression analyses allows us to reveal the correlation between the altered lipid profile with significantly enriched pathways, such as one carbon pool by folate, arachidonic acid metabolism, insulin signaling pathway, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, propanoate metabolism, and starch and sucrose metabolism. The genes in these pathways showed a good capability to classify diabetes samples.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, elevated nm23 protein expression is not correlated with diminished progression-free survival in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma. The study found that the expression of nm23 protein in the invasion status and metastatic potential of breast cancer is not associated with progression-free survival.",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, non-esterified fatty acids decreased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, insulin content and increased triglyceride content of human isolated islets, independently from the deleterious effect of glucose. Increased glucose concentrations also decreased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and insulin content, but had no influence on triglyceride content. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion of islets appeared to be significantly correlated with their triglyceride content.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, induction of oral tolerance to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) can ameliorate atherosclerosis. This was shown in a study where LDL receptor-/- mice fed a Western-type diet were given oxLDL or malondialdehyde-treated LDL (MDA-LDL) before the induction of atherogenesis. Oral tolerance to oxLDL resulted in a significant attenuation of the initiation and progression of atherogenesis. Additionally, tolerance to oxLDL induced a significant increase in CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ cells in spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes, and these cells specifically responded to oxLDL with increased transforming growth factor-beta production. Tolerance to oxLDL also increased the mRNA expression of Foxp3, CTLA-4, and CD25 in the plaque. In contrast, tolerance to MDA-LDL did not affect atherogenesis.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, in women with type 1 diabetes and insulin resistance, a more atherogenic cholesterol distribution by insulin resistance was seen.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, almost 20% of angle procedures eventually fail in pediatric glaucoma patients.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the present study tested the hypothesis that rosuvastatin treatment may attenuate left ventricular (LV) remodelling and dysfunction in the failing heart, which may be associated with alterations of Ca(2+)-regulatory protein. The study found that rosuvastatin prevented the decrease of SERCA2a and pSer16-PLB expression, increased SERCA activity, but showed no effect on PLB expression. Furthermore, rosuvastatin reduced the increased IL-6 level and further elevated IL-10 level in the peri-infarct and remote zones of MI.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, prolonged resuscitation of metabolic acidosis after trauma is associated with more complications. In the study, patients with unfavorable outcome at 6 months had a longer duration of metabolic crisis compared to those with favorable outcome. In four multivariate models, the burden of metabolic crisis was a powerful independent predictor of poor outcome.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, NSC23925 has been shown to prevent the development of multidrug resistance in ovarian cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, restoration of klotho expression induces apoptosis and autophagy in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, there is evidence to suggest that leukocytosis is proportional to the severity of HELLP syndrome. In the study, patients with class I HELLP syndrome had significantly higher WBC counts than patients with other classes of HELLP syndrome. Additionally, the WBC counts were significantly higher in patients with HELLP syndrome than in patients with severe preeclampsia alone. This suggests that leukocytosis may be a marker of the severity of HELLP syndrome and may be related to the inflammatory component of preeclampsia.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, DcR3 overexpression correlated with lymph node metastases and TNM stages in pancreatic head carcinoma. The median overall survival for the high DcR3 group was 16.3 months, compared to 21.6 months for the low DcR3 group. In the low DcR3 group, no significant difference was found in the overall survival between patients who underwent standard pancreatoduodenectomy (SPD) and those who had radical pancreatoduodenectomy (RPD). In the high DcR3 group, the median overall survival rates were 16.8 months in the RPD group and 13.5 months in the SPD group.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, a Multi-Component Prime-Boost Vaccination Regimen with a Consensus MOMP Antigen enhances Chlamydia trachomatis Clearance. The DNA-HuAd5-MVA-Protein vaccine regimen induced a cellular response with a Th1-biased serum antibody response, alongside high serum and vaginal MOMP-specific antibodies. This regimen significantly enhanced clearance against intravaginal C. trachomatis serovar D infection in both BALB/c and B6C3F1 mouse strains. This enhanced clearance was shown to be CD4(+) T-cell dependent.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the angiotensin II type 2 receptor agonist Compound 21 (C21) was found to be protective in experimental diabetes-associated atherosclerosis (DAA) in vivo and in vitro. C21 treatment significantly attenuated aortic plaque deposition in a mouse model of DAA, in association with a decreased infiltration of macrophages and mediators of inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis. In addition, C21 was found to confer profound anti-atherosclerotic actions at the in vitro level, particularly in the setting of hyperglycaemia. These atheroprotective actions of C21 were completely blocked by the AT2R antagonist PD123319.",
    "\n\nAnswer: It is unclear whether cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is independently linked to cardiometabolic risk in children. This study investigated the association between CRF level and presence of cardiometabolic risk disorders using health-related cut points, and whether these associations were mediated by abdominal adiposity in children. The strong relation between CRF and adiposity renders their independent associations to metabolic risk factors difficult to ascertain.\n\nTo examine the independent associations of muscle fitness and cardiorespiratory fitness with clustered metabolic risk in youth, the study found that both muscle fitness and cardiorespiratory fitness were independently associated with clustered metabolic risk in youth. However, the study did not find any significant association between muscle fitness and cardiorespiratory fitness with clustered metabolic risk in youth.\n\nTherefore, it is unclear whether fitness and adiposity are independently associated with cardiometabolic risk in youth.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, patient-prosthesis mismatch in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement can affect survival. A study examined the outcomes of isolated aortic valve replacement performed with a 17-mm mechanical prosthesis in patients with aortic stenosis and found that patients with prosthesis-patient mismatch had significantly higher transprosthesis gradients postoperatively and an independent detrimental effect of prosthesis-patient mismatch on survival was observed in patients with aortic stenosis/mixed disease who had preoperative left ventricular dysfunction. In another study, moderate or severe prosthesis-patient mismatch was a significant predictor of poorer survival in patients with aortic stenosis/mixed disease, even after adjustment for all significant clinical predictors.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the study found that a high frequency of competitive sports early in life is associated with bone mineral density (BMD) at several bone sites, indicating that increases in BMD following PA are preserved longer than previously believed. However, the study did not specifically investigate the association between lifetime sport and leisure activity participation and greater bone size, quality and strength in older men.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The provided context discusses the role of Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF/CCN2) in fibrosis of the kidney, but it does not directly answer the question about whether hemizygous deletion of CTGF/CCN2 suffices to prevent fibrosis of the severely injured kidney.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, severity of hepatic encephalopathy before liver transplantation is associated with quality of life after transplantation. This is because hepatic encephalopathy has a negative impact on health-related quality of life (QoL) in liver cirrhosis.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, sutureless securement device StatLock has been shown to reduce catheter-related complications when compared to tape in a study. The study randomized 170 patients requiring PICCs to suture or StatLock securement and followed them throughout their entire catheter course. PICC-related complications including dislodgment, infection, occlusion, leakage, and central venous thrombosis were documented and compared between the suture and StatLock groups. The results showed that the StatLock group had a significantly lower incidence of catheter-related complications compared to the suture group.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, attachment to laminin-111 facilitates transforming growth factor beta-induced expression of matrix metalloproteinase-3 in synovial fibroblasts.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, functional health literacy is associated with health status and health-related knowledge in people living with HIV-AIDS. A study conducted on a community-recruited sample of 339 HIV-infected men and women found that lower health literacy was associated with poorer health status, lower CD4 cell counts, higher viral loads, less likelihood of taking antiretroviral medications, greater number of hospitalizations, and poorer health outcomes. In addition, lower health literacy was associated with poorer knowledge of one's HIV-related health status, poorer AIDS-related disease and treatment knowledge, and more negative health care perceptions and experiences.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, a trans-aortic Alfieri stitch can be placed at the time of septal myectomy for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The provided context indicates that a computer-assisted instruction (CAI) tutorial program was compared to traditional methods in undergraduate dietetics students to evaluate its efficacy in improving clinical reasoning skills. The results showed that the students who completed the CAI tutorial program had a significant improvement in their readiness to practice their role as clinical dietitians, as well as in their professional role and charting skills. However, the improvement was not statistically significant in all areas. Additionally, the students found the CAI tutorial program to be superior to the medical center experience and agreed that collaboration with other healthcare professionals helped prepare them for the dietetic role. Therefore, the provided context suggests that computer-assisted instruction can improve clinical reasoning skills of dietetics students, but the improvement may not be statistically significant in all areas.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, soy protein isolates of varied isoflavone content can influence serum thyroid hormones in healthy young men. The study found that consumption of high-isoflavone soy protein isolate (61.7 +/- 7.4 mg iso/day) led to a 14% decline in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, but no change in testosterone levels, as compared to the low-isoflavone soy protein isolate (1.64 +/- 0.19 mg iso/day) and milk protein isolate (MPI) groups. However, there were no significant between-group and within-group differences in total triiodothyronine (T3), free T3, total thyroxine (T4), free T4, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and thyroid binding globulin (TBG) levels.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, immunity to blood stages of Plasmodium falciparum is dependent on a specific pattern of immunoglobulin subclass responses to multiple blood stage antigens. This is supported by previous studies showing that IgG1 and IgG3 responses against antigens like ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigens, merozoite surface proteins and variant surface antigens on schizonts were associated with clinical immunity against malaria. None of the specific responses against a single antigen was completely protective.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, recombination pattern reanalysis of some HIV-1 circulating recombination forms (CRFs) suggests the necessity and difficulty of revision. The current study was based on multiple recombination analysis, which may have produced more impartial results. The analysis based on the predicted networks suggests the following: significantly stronger recombination signals for the inferred ancestors of the X4 strains, recombination events between different lineages and recombination events between putative reservoir virus and those from a later population, an early star-like topology observed for four of the patients who died of AIDS. A significantly higher number of recombinants were predicted at sampling points that corresponded to peaks in the viral load levels. These findings suggest that recombination pattern reanalysis of some HIV-1 CRFs may be necessary and difficult.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The provided context discusses the role of osteopontin (OPN) in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury and repair. However, it does not directly address whether OPN enhances endogenous repair after neonatal HI brain injury.",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, p130 plays a role in TGF-beta-induced cell-cycle arrest in Rb mutant HT-3 cells. TGF-beta inhibited the proliferation of HT-3 cells expressing mutant Rb protein and efficiently induced cell-cycle arrest at G(1) phase. p21 protein level was elevated in TGF-beta-treated HT-3 cells, while other G(1) regulatory protein levels were unaltered. TGF-beta markedly enhanced the binding of p21 with cdk2 but decreased that of cdk2 with cyclin E and inhibited the phosphorylation of p130 but did not change Rb and p107 protein status. We also found that E2F-1 protein level was lower in TGF-beta-treated cells and suggest that this might be the result of enhanced binding between E2F-4 and p130.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, past cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3, obesity, and earlier menopause are associated with an increased risk of vulval cancer in postmenopausal women.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, severity of coronary artery disease is correlated to cerebrovascular reactivity, but degree of coronary stenosis is not.",

The study found that family-centered multidisciplinary rounds were associated with improved patient and family experiences, as well as increased health service use.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, high doses of EDU were not toxic to willow and did not act as nitrogen fertilizer. The study found that all EDU was transferred to the leaves and high doses of EDU increased the leaf N content. However, EDU did not affect the C content and distribution within the plant body. Additionally, the study found that EDU did not persist in the soil and there was no EDU toxicity to willow.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, high maternal body mass index (BMI) increases the risk of neonatal early onset group B streptococcal (EOGBS) disease. In obese parturients with BMI > 30, there was an 80% increased risk for verified neonatal EOGBS disease (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.0). When cases with clinical sepsis were included a significant risk increment was also found in overweight women with BMI 25.0-29.9 (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.0).",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) decreases acute pneumonitis after irradiation in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro studies showed that CAPE cause no significant cytotoxicity in normal lung as compared to lung cancer cells. The results from in vivo study showed that CAPE treatment decreased the expression of inflammatory cytokines including IL-1 alpha and beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha and TGF- beta, after irradiation. Moreover, histological and immunochemical data revealed that CAPE decreased radiation- induced interstitial pneumonitis and TGF-beta expression.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study by [Document(page_content='The aim of this study was to assess the effects of early thymoglobulin administration on cardiocyte nuclear status in orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) recipients.')] did not specifically assess early myocardial hypertrophy. However, the study by [Document(page_content='Statins improve patient survival and decrease rejection episodes in heart transplant recipients. We studied the effects of simvastatin treatment on myocardial tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) expression; TNF-alpha is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine associated with hypertrophy and fibrosis in heart transplant recipients.')] did not specifically assess early myocardial hypertrophy, but it did assess the effects of simvastatin treatment on myocardial TNF-alpha expression, which is associated with hypertrophy and fibrosis. The study by [Document(page_content='Antithymocyte therapy, specifically antithymocyte globulin (ATG; Thymoglobulin), is increasingly being used in organ transplantation to reduce allograft rejection. The T-lymphocyte has been purported to also play a role in ischemia and reperfusion injury (IR",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, dNA-PKcs expression was found to be closely associated with biochemical recurrence in patients treated by permanent iodine 125 interstitial brachytherapy for prostate cancer. On multivariate analysis, dNA-PKcs expression remained predictive of recurrence, along with the Gleason score and prostate-specific antigen level.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, chemotherapy for cancer does not cause apoptosis that precedes hypoplasia in crypts of the small intestine in humans. The study found that apoptosis increased sevenfold in intestinal crypts at one day, and villus area, crypt length, mitotic count per crypt, and enterocyte height decreased at three days after chemotherapy. However, the study did not find any correlation between apoptosis and hypoplasia in the small intestine.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, alveolar macrophage gene expression is altered in the setting of alcohol use disorders. A study was conducted to determine the effects of AUDs on human alveolar macrophage gene expression. The study found that chronic alcohol consumption causes persistent oxidative stress in the lung, leading to impaired alveolar macrophage (AM) function and impaired immune responses. The study also found that alcohol-induced oxidative stress increases the expression of transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF\u03b21) in the lung. Additionally, the study found that whole genome microarray analysis was performed on alveolar macrophages obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage from a test cohort of subjects with AUDs and controls who were pair-matched on age, gender, and smoking. Probe set expression differences in this cohort were validated by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT RT-PCR). Functional analysis with web-based bioinformatics tools was utilized with microarray data to assess differentially expressed candidate genes (p < 0.01) based on alcohol consumption. Alveolar macrophage mRNA samples from a second cohort of subjects with AUDs and controls were used to confirm gene expression differences related to AUDs.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, a diminished postnatal surge of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants is additional evidence for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The study found that the number of Ad spermatogonia increased markedly after five months of life in the control population, but it was distinctly lower in the cryptorchid testes. This surge was completely absent in the cryptorchid testes. The number of Ad spermatogonia in unilateral cryptorchid testes correlated in a nonlinear fashion with those in the contralateral scrotal testes. The total number of germ cells in the cryptorchid testes in the first six months of life is normal, after which time it declines rapidly. This suggests that the development of Ad spermatogonia is impaired in cryptorchid infants, which is consistent with the diagnosis of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, female children were nearly three times more likely to be stunted than male children. Households that were food insecure with hunger were also three times more likely than other households to have a stunted child.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, combination therapy with VELCADE and tissue plasminogen activator is neuroprotective in aged rats after stroke and targets microRNA-146a and the toll-like receptor signaling pathway. The present study tested the hypothesis that combination treatment with VELCADE and tissue plasminogen activator modulates the TLR signaling pathway on cerebral vasculature, which leads to neuroprotection in aged rats after stroke. The study found that combination treatment with VELCADE and tissue plasminogen activator reduced infarct volume compared with respective monotherapies. The study also found that the combination treatment increased miR-l46a levels, which was inversely associated with the reduction of vascular interleukin-1 receptor-activated kinases 1 immunoreactivity. In vitro, fibrin upregulated interleukin-1 receptor-activated kinases 1 and TLR4 expression and downregulated miR-146a on primary human cerebral endothelial cells. VELCADE elevated miR-146 levels and abolished fibrin-increased interleukin-1 receptor activated kinases 1 proteins. The study also found that microglia activation after stroke is characterized by marked and long-term",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, the study found that peak weight velocity (PWV) during the first two years of life was positively associated with spirometric lung function indices at 15 years of age.",
    "\n\nAnswer: There is no information provided in the context that directly addresses the question of whether garlic-derived S-allylmercaptocysteine is a hepato-protective agent in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in vivo animal model. However, it is mentioned that S-allylmercaptocysteine has been shown to have cancer-preventive and tumor-suppressive effects in vitro studies, and it is being tested in vivo for the first time in this study. Additionally, it is mentioned that N- acetylcysteine is being evaluated in the process of liver injury in non-alcoholic fatty liver change.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, chest compression fraction determines survival in patients with out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation. The study found that the odds ratios of surviving to hospital discharge in the 2 highest categories of chest compression fraction compared with the reference category were 3.01 (95% confidence interval 1.37 to 6.58) and 2.33 (95% confidence interval 0.96 to 5.63).",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, expression of snail in pancreatic cancer promotes metastasis and chemoresistance. In a study, snail was found to be expressed in 36% of pancreatic cancer samples and its expression was closely correlated with lymph node invasion and distant metastasis. After transfecting snail cDNA into pancreatic cancer cell line Panc-1, it was found that snail triggered overt epithelial to mesenchymal transitions in Panc-1 cells, promoting the invasive ability in vitro and enhancing the chemoresistance to 5-fluorouracil of gemcitabine at different dosages. Moreover, snail-transfected Panc-1 cells produced more spontaneous metastasis than parental untransfected cells after orthotopically injected into the pancreas of nude mice.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, knockdown of SLUG significantly inhibited lung cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Furthermore, knockdown of SLUG induced the down-regulation of Bcl-2 and up-regulation of E-cadherin.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study included 36 women with moderately advanced local breast cancer larger than 2 cm in diameter. Twelve were allocated to receive a standard regimen of 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (FEC) preoperatively as controls, and 24 were given the most suitable regimen according to testing; the options were FEC, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF), 5-fluorouracil, adriamycin and mitomycin C (FAM) and paclitaxel alone. The cell activities of drug-treated solid tumors were compared to controls with a highly sensitive ATP bioluminescence assay. Patients received chemotherapy according to sensitivity results and the tumor area clinically measured before and after chemotherapy. The study did not specifically evaluate the role of postoperative CMF in ameliorating poor outcomes in women with residual invasive breast cancer after neoadjuvant epirubicin/docetaxel chemotherapy.",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, prenatal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure during the final 2 weeks of pregnancy induced schizophrenia-like behavioral symptoms, such as deficits in sensorimotor gating (prepulse inhibition) and impairments in social interactions and exploration, in adult offspring. Moreover, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that in our neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia, decreases in the total number of PV- and GAD67-positive neurons in the medial prefrontal cortices of adult females prenatally exposed to LPS were observed, whereas these immunochemical changes were primarily detected in the hippocampus of males. Additionally, a decrease in PV-labeled axon terminals of GABA-ergic cells, likely reflecting the perisomatic inhibitory innervation of pyramidal neurons, was observed in the medial prefrontal cortices in both sexes.\n\nCompared to the control group, the LPS-treated dams presented reduced maternal behavior, decreased general activity, a smaller body weight difference between GD21 and PND1, a greater number of perinatal deaths, and smaller litters. For the male pups, LPS treatment resulted in a decreased body weight on PND2, whereas",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (AFABP) levels are significantly elevated in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and correlate with indices of adiposity, inflammation, and fibrosis. AFABP is a key mediator of inflammatory response in macrophages and plays a role in both lipopolysaccaride (LPS)-induced acute liver injury and high fat high cholesterol (HFHC) diet-induced NAFLD in mice.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, timing variability during gait initiation was increased in people with Alzheimer's disease compared to controls. The study found that AD participants had greater variability than controls in stride timing (AD CV = 4.65, Control CV = 3.64; p < 0.05, d = 0.71) and double support proportion (AD CV = 9.40, Control CV = 7.62; p < 0.05, d = 0.8).",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, pitching biomechanics as a pitcher approaches muscular fatigue during a simulated baseball game. According to the study, as a pitcher approaches muscular fatigue, select pitching biomechanical variables will be significantly different than they were before muscular fatigue. During the final 2 innings of the simulated baseball game, the pitcher's ball velocity decreased and the trunk was significantly closer to a vertical position. There were no other significant differences in kinematics or kinetics variables.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the bisphosphonate Pamidronate has been shown to improve chemically induced trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid and dextran sulfate sodium colitis in rats and lymphocyte transfer colitis in mice. Pamidronate has no effect on intestinal epithelial cells in vitro in terms of cytokine/chemokine release, but enhances IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, and IL-10 production by T cells in coculture. Pamidronate also exerts a direct immunomodulatory effect on T cells, favoring Th1 differentiation and impairing Th17 polarization.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, experience with bilateral cochlear implants improves sound localization acuity in children. A study conducted on children who underwent sequential bilateral cochlear implantation showed that they had a smaller minimum audible angle (MAA) compared to children who underwent unilateral cochlear implantation. The MAA is a measure of the smallest angle from midline that can be reliably discriminated, and a smaller MAA indicates better sound localization acuity. The study also found that children with bilateral cochlear implants performed better in the right-left discrimination task, which is a feasible and reliable task for measuring sound localization ability in children.",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the study found a strong logarithmic correlation between a decrease in the corneal endothelial cell density (ECD) and the percentage of pterygium to cornea in patients with unilateral primary pterygium. The difference in the corneal ECD between eyes with pterygium and control eyes ranged from +9.6% to -37.7%, with a median of -9.75%. The results of the Pearson correlation statistical test showed a strong logarithmic correlation between a decrease in the corneal ECD and the percentage of pterygium to cornea (R = 0.688, P < 0.001).",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, long-term reversal of hypocholesterolaemia in patients with chronic hepatitis C is related to sustained viral response and viral genotype. In patients with genotype-3 of HCV and sustained viral response, serum cholesterol increased from 138 (95% CI: 120-151) to 180 mg/dL (95% CI: 171-199) 12 months after treatment conclusion (P < 0.0001). By contrast, cholesterol values were unchanged in genotype-3 of HCV non-responders and in patients with genotype-1 of HCV regardless of response. Rising cholesterol in sustained viral response did not parallel the changes in beta-hydroxybutyrate.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, the present study did not find any association between life style interventions/weight reduction and decreased levels of cathepsins L and S in plasma in moderately overweight individuals. The study aimed to see if life style interventions/weight reduction could decrease cathepsin L and S levels in blood plasma, but the results did not support this hypothesis.",
    "\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe provided context discusses several studies that have investigated the association between polymorphisms in the CYP11B2 gene and hypertension in the Chinese population. However, it does not mention any novel polymorphism of the CYP19 gene being associated with essential hypertension in China. Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot answer the question about a novel polymorphism of the CYP19 gene being associated with essential hypertension in China.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, different alternative splicing (AS) patterns may be subject to opposite selection pressure for protein reading frame preservation. Simple and complex ASEs, respectively, have higher and lower FRFPs than constitutively spliced exons (CSEs). Since complex ASEs may alter the ends of their flanking exons, the selection pressure on frame preservation is likely relaxed in this ASE type. Furthermore, conservation of the ASE/CSE splicing pattern increases the FRFPs of simple ASEs but decreases those of complex ASEs. Contrary to the well-recognized concept of strong selection pressure on conserved ASEs for protein reading frame preservation, our results show that conserved complex ASEs are relaxed from such pressure and the frame-disrupting effect caused by the insertion of complex ASEs can be offset by compensatory changes in their flanking exons.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, high nuclear expression of HDGF correlates with disease progression and poor prognosis in human endometrial carcinoma. A study examined the correlation between high nuclear expression of HDGF and clinicopathologic data in endometrial carcinoma (EC), including patient survival. The study found that higher HDGF expression was significantly associated with lymphatic metastasis and poorer 5-year overall survival rate. Furthermore, HDGF expression was identified as an independent prognostic factor with multivariate analysis. Experiments in vitro also proved that HDGF exists in all ovarian cancer cell lines with different expression levels.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The provided context does not clearly indicate whether 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scanning is more useful in follow-up than in the initial assessment of patients with Erdheim-Chester disease.

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, air quality can influence the prevalence of hay fever and sinusitis. The National Health Interview Survey for the calendar years 1997-2006 adult sample was analyzed to determine for each calendar year the one-year period prevalence of the two respiratory conditions, hay fever and sinusitis and the nonrespiratory (control) condition, weak/failing kidneys. From the Environmental Protection Agency, yearly historical data for air quality criteria pollutants, carbon monoxide, nitrous dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter, were tabulated. Graphical and linear regression analyses were conducted for each disease condition against each of the air quality variables to determine if higher pollutant concentrations predicted a higher prevalence for the disease condition.\n\nFurthermore, nasal irritation and associated symptoms (nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and sinus headache) are important elements of the response to indoor and outdoor air pollution. Marked interindividual variability in such symptoms has been suggested clinically and epidemiologically, but little experimental data exist on this issue.\n\nIn the study, fifty patients (mean age, 23.7 +/- 4.9 years) with hay fever were evaluated both during and outside pollen season. All of them had moderate-severe grade of",

    "\n\nAnswer: The study suggests that the age of first exposure to Toxoplasma gondii may affect the development of anti-NMDA receptor autoantibodies and associated neurobehavioral pathology in mice. Juvenile-infected mice exhibited decreased pre-pulse inhibition of the acoustic startle (PPI) in response to MK-801, while adult-infected mice exhibited increased PPI in response to MK-801. Additionally, juvenile-infected mice had significantly greater elevations of GLUN2 autoantibodies compared to adult-infected mice. Age-dependent differences were also found in regional expression of NMDAR subunits and markers of glutamatergic, GABAergic, and monoaminergic systems. However, the study did not directly investigate the role of age of first exposure in the development of anti-NMDA receptor autoantibodies and associated neurobehavioral pathology in humans.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, risedronate gastrointestinal absorption is not independent of site and rate of administration.

    "\n\nAnswer: The study aimed to elucidate the role of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) in regulating apoptosis of tubular epithelial cells in a hypoxia-reperfusion model. However, the provided context does not contain any information about the specific role of NGAL in protecting renal tubular epithelial cells in hypoxia-reperfusion by reducing apoptosis.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, high body mass index (BMI) is associated with increased diurnal strains in the articular cartilage of the knee. Subjects with high BMI had significantly thicker cartilage on both the patella and femoral groove, as compared to subjects with normal BMI. Diurnal cartilage strains were dependent on location in the knee joint, as well as BMI. Subjects with high BMI, compared to those with normal BMI, exhibited significantly higher compressive strains in the tibial cartilage. Cartilage thickness on both femoral condyles decreased significantly from the AM to the PM time point; however, there was no significant effect of BMI on diurnal cartilage strain in the femur.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, corticosterone is involved in electroacupuncture-produced anti-edema in a rat model of inflammation. Electroacupuncture (EA) significantly increased plasma corticosterone levels 2 hours and 5 hours after complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) administration compared to sham EA control, but EA alone in naive rats and CFA alone did not induce significant increases in corticosterone. Adrenalectomy blocked EA-produced anti-edema, but not EA anti-hyperalgesia. RU486, a prototypical glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, also prevented EA anti-edema.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the study suggests that soluble oncoprotein 185HER-2 in pleural fluid has limited usefulness for the diagnostic evaluation of malignant effusions. The sensitivity of pleural sp185(HER-2) levels greater than 25 ng/mL for predicting a malignant effusion is only 7%, and adding sp185(HER-2) to a panel of CEA and CA 15-3 did not significantly increase sensitivity. Additionally, the diagnostic accuracy of PF OPN for malignancy is only 71.5%.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, the study did not investigate the direct effects of Bevacizumab on mitochondria isolated from human brain tumors. The study only investigated the direct effects of Temozolomide and Bevacizumab on mitochondria isolated from human brain tumors, and compared these effects on mitochondria isolated from low- and high-grade human brain tumors.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study found that plasma vasopressin expressed a diurnal rhythm with a night-time increase in both genders, but there was no difference in urine osmolality or aquaporin-2 excretion between genders. There was a trend towards a higher reabsorption of free water in males, and the excretion of prostaglandin E2 was higher in males. However, there was no diurnal rhythm in p-oxytocin and no correlation to diuresis, urine osmolality or aquaporin-2 excretions. Therefore, urinary concentration does not exclusively rely on plasma vasopressin, and other factors such as reabsorption of free water and prostaglandin E2 excretion may also play a role in diurnal urine regulation.",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, adherence to the 2006 American Heart Association Diet and Lifestyle Recommendations (AHA-DLR) is associated with bone health in older Puerto Ricans. In a cross-sectional study of 933 Puerto Ricans aged 47-79 y, the American Heart Association Diet and Lifestyle Score (AHA-DLS) was modified to test associations with bone health. Bone mineral density (BMD) at the femoral neck, trochanter, total hip, and lumbar spine (L2-L4) was measured by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The results showed that adherence to the AHA-DLR was associated with higher BMD at all bone sites.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, basophils are recruited to inflamed lungs in mice and humans and exacerbate memory Th2 responses.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Basophils accumulated in lungs of OVA-immunized mice.\n* Adoptive transfer of basophils to OVA-sensitized hosts enhanced lung IL-4 and IL-13 release while co-administration of OVA further aggravated airway inflammation and Th2 responses in LNs.\n* Human basophils augmented in vitro IL-4 expression in effector memory CD4 T cells that include CRTH2(+) cells through IL-4 and TCR-independent pathways.\n* Several studies in mice have shown that basophils can act as antigen-presenting cells (APC) inducing Th2-mediated immune responses against parasites or protease allergens.\n* IgG4-related disease (IRD) is characterized by systemic IgG4 antibody responses and by infiltration of IgG4-expressing plasma cells into the affected organs. Although T helper type 2 (Th2) cytokines are implicated in enhanced IgG4 responses, molecular mechanisms accounting for the development of IgG4 antibody responses are poorly defined. Since basophils function as antigen",

Long-term administration of either drug results in alleviation of behavioral alterations mimicking some negative symptoms and partial amelioration of some cognitive defects in STOP null mice. Additionally, clozapine treatment also improves synaptic plasticity of the STOP null animals by restoring long-term potentiation in the hippocampus.",
    "\n\nAnswer:\n\nChlamydia pneumoniae has been associated with atherosclerotic disease, but it is unclear whether infection has a genuinely etiologic role in this disease and whether its presence influences clinical outcomes. To investigate this issue, researchers used molecular biological detection methods and clinically relevant indicators of pathology in carotid artery atheroma in patients with advanced carotid artery atherosclerosis. They found that the presence of C pneumoniae correlates with plaque instability.\n\nHowever, the process of atherosclerosis is complex and involves multiple factors, including inflammation and infection. Chlamydia pneumoniae has been identified in atherosclerotic plaques, but the studies about the presence of C. pneumoniae in degenerative aortic stenotic valves are not conclusive. Therefore, it is important to consider other factors that may influence atherosclerotic plaque behavior in patients with established carotid artery stenosis.\n\nIn addition, the intracellular bacterium Chlamydia pneumoniae is suspected to play a role in formation and progression of atherosclerosis. However, little is known about the pathogenic link in atherosclerosis in primary human aortic smooth muscle cells, a cell type among",

The study showed that rats in the moxibustion group had a markedly higher degranulation ratio of mast cells at ST25 acupoint areas compared to the model group (45.91 \u00b1 11.41 vs 32.58 \u00b1 8.28, P < 0.05).",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, optic nerve blood flow is diminished in eyes of primary open-angle glaucoma suspects. This is based on the context provided, which states that the purpose of the study was to evaluate optic nerve blood flow in primary open-angle glaucoma suspect eyes with normal automated visual fields, and to assess blood flow in the vessels of the eyeball and changes in the optic nerve in patients with arterial hypertension and primary open-angle glaucoma. The study used laser Doppler flowmetry to measure optic nerve head blood velocity, volume, and flow at four quadrants in the optic nerve, in the cup, and in the foveola of one eye of each patient. The main outcome measure was the mean flow from the superotemporal rim, inferotemporal rim, and cup. Measurements from primary open-angle glaucoma suspect eyes were compared with corresponding measurements from controls and eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma, and a Student t test was employed with a Bonferroni corrected P value of.025 to compare the measurements."

      "The T allele of rs2289105 in CYP19 gene might be a protective genetic marker of EH for women in Han population.",
      "In this study, we find that simple and complex ASEs undergo opposite selection pressure for protein reading frame preservation, with CSEs in-between. Simple ASEs have much higher FRFPs than complex ones. We further find that the FRFPs of complex ASEs coupled with flanking exons are close to those of simple ASEs, indicating that neighboring exons of an ASE may evolve in a coordinated way to avoid protein dysfunction. Therefore, we suggest that evolutionary analyses of AS should take into consideration the effects of different splicing patterns and the joint effects of multiple AS events.",
      "Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that HDGF was expressed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. High nuclear expression of HDGF was positively correlated with FIGO stage (P = 0.032), but not associated with other clinical features, such as histological grading or lymph node status. Patients with high expression of HDGF had poorer overall survival rates than those with low expression of HDGF (P = 0.001). However, multivariate analyses showed that high nuclear expression of HDGF protein was not an independent predictor of prognosis for EC patients (P = 0.111). Our results suggest that high nuclear expression of HDGF is a potential unfavorable factor for the progression and prognosis of EC.",
      "The results of our large, single-center, retrospective study suggest that the findings of a FDG-PET scan may be interesting in the initial assessment of patients with ECD, but its greater contribution is in followup of these patients.",
      "Over expression of UCP2 in certain tumors provides the rationale to speculate that UCP2 may promote tumor growth in these cancers.",
      "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading known genetic cause of autism spectrum disorders. Individuals with FXS show symptoms of auditory hypersensitivity. These symptoms may arise due to sustained neural responses to repeated sounds, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. For the first time, this study shows deficits in habituation of neural responses to repeated sounds in the Fmr1 KO mice as seen in humans with FXS. We also report an abnormally high level of matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) in the auditory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice and that deletion of Mmp-9 from Fmr1 KO mice reverses habituation deficits. These data provide a translation relevant electrophysiological biomarker for sensory deficits in FXS and implicate MMP-9 as a target for drug discovery.",
      "Prevalence of hay fever and sinusitis are correlated with air quality. Improvements in air quality are associated with decreased prevalence of both hay fever and sinusitis. Laryngoscope, 2009.",
      "S 23521 is an effective glucagon-like peptide-1-(7-36) amide analogue, which induced a decrease in energy intake, body weight, and adiposity in a rat model of diet-induced obesity. In addition, the treatment also improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity of obese rats. These results strongly support S 23521 as a putative molecule for the treatment of obesity.",
      "Our study demonstrates that the age at first exposure to T. gondii is an important factor in shaping distinct behavioral and neurobiological abnormalities. Elevation in GLUN2 autoantibodies or complement protein C1q may be a potential underlying mechanism. A better understanding of these age-related differences may lead to more efficient treatments of behavioral disorders associated with T. gondii infection.",
      "These studies indicate that the rate and extent of risedronate absorption are independent of the site of administration along the gastrointestinal tract, and that the extent of absorption is not affected by the rate of administration.",
      "These findings indicate that NGAL reduces apoptosis by regulating the four apoptosis factors Bcl-2, Bax, Fas and FasL through its two receptors 24p3R and megalin. These results also suggest that ectopic expression of NGAL in renal cells might provide a therapeutic strategy in ischemia-reperfusion by reducing apoptosis and promoting renal cell proliferation.",
      "Increased BMI is associated with increased diurnal strains in articular cartilage of both the medial and lateral compartments of the knee. The increased cartilage strains observed in individuals with high BMI may, in part, explain the elevated risk of OA associated with obesity or may reflect alterations in the cartilage mechanical properties in subjects with high BMI.",
      "The data demonstrate that EA activates the adrenals to increase plasma corticosterone levels and suppress edema and suggest that EA effects differ in healthy subjects and in those with pathologies.",
      "Measurement of pleural fluid sp185(HER-2) has poor diagnostic performance in patients with malignant effusions.",
      "TMZ and BEV can directly cause the dysfunction of mitochondria isolated from human brain tumors. However, BEV has a greater ability to disturb mitochondrial function in mitochondria isolated from human brain tumors than either TMZ or calcium overload conditions.",
      "Similar urinary flows and osmolalities are associated with levels of plasma vasopressin and renal PGE2, which are higher in males than in females. Oxytocin does not seem to play a role in the diurnal urine formation, whereas prostaglandin E2 could represent a mediator of the gender difference, not only as a mediator of the vasopressin response, but also as an independent factor. These findings need further elucidation.",
      "MICR has a very transient impact on plasma levels of endostatin and no impact on angiostatin during the first 21 days following surgery. Thus, angiostatin and endostatin do not likely contribute to or inhibit the persistent proangiogenic changes noted after MICR.",
      "Dietary guidelines for CVD risk reduction may also benefit bone health in this Hispanic cohort. Synchronizing dietary guidelines for these 2 common diseases may provide a simplified public health message. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01231958.",
      "Basophils may worsen Th2 inflammatory disorders through direct interactions with pathogenic CD4 T cells as well as by enhancing DC-induced Th2 cell development.",
      "We conclude that inhibition of TLR4 with eritoran in an in situ murine model significantly reduces MI/R injury and markers of an inflammatory response.",
      "HMbeta supplementation can increase survival time and promotes metabolic changes in cancer-bearing animals, but it seems to work in a time-dependent manner.",
      "The probability of a successful cardioversion correlates inversely with NT-proBNP values. The short-term success of a cardioversion might be predicted by prior determination of NT-proBNP.",
      "These data provide evidence that there are no obvious adverse effects of acute or more chronic Cr supplementation on the haematological indices measured, nor on hepatic, muscle, and renal function. Therefore there is no apparent health risk associated with Cr supplementation to healthy people when it is ingested in quantities that have been scientifically proven to increase muscle Cr stores.",
      "Our data provide strong evidence that both cAMP effectors, Epac and PKA, and the levels of intracellular calcium are involved in the hepatic cystogenesis of ARPKD.",
      "All together, the pharmacological reactivity of STOP null mice to antipsychotics evokes the pharmacological response of humans to such drugs. Totally, our study suggests that STOP null mice may provide a useful preclinical model to evaluate pharmacological properties of antipsychotic drugs.",
      "This study confirms that C pneumoniae is a common finding in atherosclerotic plaques of the carotid artery but suggests that the presence of the infectious organism has little detectable impact on plaque instability when measured by clinically significant markers. This raises important questions for the rationale of antibiotic therapy in atherosclerosis.",
      "Moxibustion exerted its effect on healing impaired colonic mucosa in rats with TNBS-induced colitis by increasing the degranulation ratio of local MC, but had little effect on the morphology of MC at ST25 acupoint.",
      "Laser Doppler flowmetry detected circulatory abnormalities in primary open-angle glaucoma suspects who did not have any manifest visual field defect. Decreases in flow in glaucoma suspects were similar in magnitude to those of subjects with primary open-angle glaucoma. These data suggest that impaired optic nerve blood flow develops early in the glaucomatous process and does not develop solely as a result of glaucoma damage."
