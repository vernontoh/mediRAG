    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, obvious emphysema on computed tomography during an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is associated with a poor prognosis. This is based on the findings of a study that recorded histories and acquired CT images for 106 patients who visited the emergency department for an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Emphysematous change was quantified by measuring the percentage of low-attenuation areas (LAA%) in the entire lung on CT images with a threshold of -950 Hounsfield units. Other factors that could influence AECOPD prognosis were also recorded on admission and analysed. At follow-ups conducted in 1 year, patient survival, the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnoea Scale, and performance status (PS) were evaluated, and a COPD Assessment Test (CAT) was completed. The study found that acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)--typically caused by bacterial or viral infection--is associated with poor prognosis and emphysema progression through unknown mechanisms.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, chemokine expression patterns in the systemic and genital tract compartments are associated with HIV-1 infection in women from Benin.\n\nExplanation: The study compared levels of both genital mucosal and blood chemokines between HIV-1-uninfected and HIV-1-infected female commercial sex workers (CSWs) as well as HIV-1-uninfected non-CSW control women at low risk for exposure, recruited in Cotonou, Benin. The study found that levels of chemokines in the systemic and genital tract compartments were associated with HIV-1 infection in women from Benin. Specifically, the study found that levels of chemokines in the systemic and genital tract compartments were significantly higher in HIV-1-infected women compared to HIV-1-uninfected women. The study also found that levels of chemokines in the systemic and genital tract compartments were significantly higher in HIV-1-infected women compared to HIV-1-uninfected non-CSW control women at low risk for exposure. Overall, the study suggests that chemokine expression patterns in the systemic and genital tract compartments are associated with HIV-1 infection in women from Benin.",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the DNA methylation of the retinoid acid receptor beta (RARbeta), cellular retinol-binding protein 1 (CRBP1), and tazarotene-induced gene 1 (TIG1) genes was associated with their expression in gastric carcinoma (GC). In 7 of 8 GC cell lines, the CRBP1 gene was hypermethylated, and CRBP1 transcription was inactive. In 6 of 8 GC cell lines, the TIG1 gene was hypermethylated, and TIG1 transcription was inactive. Treatment with demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restored both CRBP1 and TIG1 transcription. DNA methylation of the RARbeta, CRBP1, and TIG1 genes was detected in 15 of 42 GC samples (36%), 14 of 42 GC samples (33%), and 4 of 42 GC samples (10%), respectively, and in 6 of 30 samples (20%), 0 of 30 samples (0%), and 1 of 30 samples (3%) of corresponding nonneoplastic mucosa.

    "\n\nAnswer: No, antiangiogenic therapy of cerebral melanoma metastases does not result in sustained tumor progression via vessel co-option. The study showed that antiangiogenic treatment inhibits the progression of leptomeningeal tumors. However, the study did not investigate the mechanism by which antiangiogenic treatment inhibits tumor progression. It is possible that antiangiogenic treatment inhibits tumor progression via vessel co-option, but further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, clove and eugenol in noncytotoxic concentrations exert immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory action on cytokine production by murine macrophages. Clove (100\u00b5g/well) inhibited IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-10 production and exerted an efficient action either before or after LPS challenge for all cytokines. Eugenol did not affect IL-1\u03b2 production but inhibited IL-6 and IL-10 production. The action of eugenol (50 or 100\u00b5g/well) on IL-6 production prevented efficiently effects of LPS either before or after its addition, whereas on IL-10 production it counteracted significantly LPS action when added after LPS incubation. The LC-MS analysis of OSAE and OSWE revealed the presence of several bioactive compounds including eugenol. Quantitative analysis revealed that OSAE and OSWE had EUG of 12 ng/mgdwt and 19 ng/mgdwt respectively. OSAE, OSWE (1 mg dwt/mL) pure compound EUG (60 \u00b5g/mL) and positive control IMT (20 \u00b5g/mL) showed marked inhibition on LPS induced T",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, pretreatment with stellate ganglion blockade before ischemia does not reduce infarct size in rat hearts.\n\nExplanation: The study found that infarcted rats showed cardiac functional impairment and increased heart and lung weight, and the extent of these changes correlated well with infarct size. However, the study did not find any significant difference in infarct size between rats with and without ganglionic blockade.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, lipidomics reveals multiple pathway effects of a multi-components preparation on lipid biochemistry in ApoE*3Leiden.CETP mice. The preparation SUB885C caused significant reductions in plasma cholesterol, CETP levels, CETP activity, and increased HDL-C. It influenced lipidomics classes of cholesterol esters and triglycerides the most. In vitro, SUB885C extract caused adipolysis stimulation and adipogenesis inhibition in 3T3-L1 cells.",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, leukotriene B ( 4 ) enhances tumour necrosis factor-alpha-induced CCL27 production in human keratinocytes.\n\nExplanation: The study aimed to investigate the in vitro effects of LTB(4) on CCL27 production in human keratinocytes. The results showed that LTB(4) enhanced TNF-alpha-induced CCL27 production in human keratinocytes. This suggests that LTB(4) may be involved in the development of allergic dermatoses, which are characterized by enhanced CCL27 production in skin lesions.",
    "\n\nAnswer: There is limited evidence to suggest that hemoglobin levels may predict biochemical outcome for localized prostate cancer treated with neoadjuvant androgen-suppression therapy and external-beam radiotherapy. However, some studies have found a strong association between hemoglobin levels and tumor control in head and neck cancer treated with radiotherapy, and consideration of correcting anemia before initiation of radiation therapy may be important in this context.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The evidence suggests that non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) can impair insulin-mediated glucose uptake and disposition in the liver. Studies have shown that NEFA concentrations are associated with fatty liver independently of whole-body glucose production and disposal measurements. Additionally, NEFA suppression during the OGTT was decreased in individuals with mild to moderate and severe fatty liver, and the insulin sensitivity index for NEFA was decreased in these groups. These findings suggest that NEFAs may play a role in the development and progression of fatty liver disease. However, it is important to note that the relationship between NEFAs and fatty liver is complex and may be influenced by other factors such as diet and lifestyle. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying this relationship and to develop effective interventions for the prevention and treatment of fatty liver disease.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, induction of oral tolerance to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) attenuates the initiation and progression of atherogenesis in LDL receptor-/- mice fed a Western-type diet. This is achieved through an increase in CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ cells in spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes, which specifically respond to oxLDL with increased transforming growth factor-beta production. Additionally, tolerization increases the mRNA expression of Foxp3, CTLA-4, and CD25 in the plaque. In contrast, tolerance to malondialdehyde-treated LDL (MDA-LDL) does not affect atherogenesis.",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the present study tested the hypothesis that rosuvastatin treatment may attenuate left ventricular (LV) remodelling and dysfunction in the failing heart, which may be associated with alterations of Ca(2+)-regulatory protein. The study investigated the change of LV remodelling and function in a rat model of cardiac dysfunction due to myocardial infarction (MI) with or without rosuvastatin (10 mg/kg/day) treatment for 10 weeks. The protein expression of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA)2a, phospholamban (PLB), and phospho-PLB at serine-16 (pSer16-PLB), as well as SERCA activity, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-10 levels were evaluated. After rosuvastatin treatment, LV remodelling and dysfunction were prevented. Rosuvastatin prevented the decrease of SERCA2a and pSer16-PLB expression, increased SERCA activity, but showed no effect on PLB expression. Furthermore, rosuvastatin reduced the increased IL-6 level and further elevated IL-10 level in the peri-infarct and remote zones of MI. Serum lipid levels remained",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, prolonged resuscitation of metabolic acidosis after trauma is associated with more complications. In the study, morbidly obese patients with persistent metabolic acidosis developed MOF at a significantly greater rate than did normal weight patients with or without persistent metabolic acidosis. Additionally, in patients with successful resuscitation and controlled ICP, within 72 h of trauma, 76% had low glucose, 93% had elevated LPR, and 74% were in metabolic crisis. The duration of metabolic crisis was longer in those patients with unfavorable (GOSe \u2264 6) versus favorable (GOSe \u2265 7) outcome at 6 months. In four multivariate models, the burden of metabolic crisis was a powerful independent predictor of poor outcome.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, NSC23925 has been shown to prevent the development of multidrug resistance in osteosarcoma cells in vitro. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of NSC23925 on the prevention of multidrug resistance in ovarian cancer, especially in vivo.\n\nSource:\n<context>\n[Document(page_content='The development of multidrug resistance (MDR) remains the significant clinical challenge in ovarian cancer therapy; however, relatively little is known about how to prevent the emergence of MDR during chemotherapy treatment.

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, restoration of klotho expression induces apoptosis and autophagy in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, leukocytosis is proportional to HELLP syndrome severity. The study found that patients with class I HELLP syndrome had significantly higher WBC counts than patients with other classes of HELLP syndrome. Additionally, the WBC counts were significantly higher in patients with HELLP syndrome than in patients with severe preeclampsia alone. The study also found that circulating TSP-1 levels were lower in HELLP syndrome compared to all other study groups, while they were unaltered in preeclampsia compared to the control groups. There was a significant positive linear correlation between TSP-1 levels and platelet count in HELLP syndrome. In patients with more severe HELLP syndrome, TSP-1 levels were significantly lower compared to women suffering from a milder form of HELLP syndrome. These findings suggest that HELLP syndrome is an inflammatory form of preeclampsia, and leukocytosis is a marker of this inflammation.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, high DcR3 expression was associated with high-grade and high-stage renal cell carcinomas (RCCs). The incidence of distant metastasis and lymph node metastasis was significantly higher in the group with high DcR3 expression. Decoy receptor 3 expression correlated negatively with disease-specific survival and progression-free survival in univariate analyses. A multivariate Cox regression analysis retained DcR3 expression as an independent prognostic factor that outperformed the Karnofsky performance status. In patients with high-stage RCCs expressing DcR3, the 2-year survival probability was 25%, whereas in patients with DcR3-negative tumors, the survival probability was 65% (P <.001). Moreover, DcR3 serum levels were significantly higher in patients with high-stage localized disease and metastatic disease.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, a Multi-Component Prime-Boost Vaccination Regimen with a Consensus MOMP Antigen enhances Chlamydia trachomatis Clearance.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe study found that a Multi-Component Prime-Boost Vaccination Regimen with a Consensus MOMP Antigen significantly enhanced clearance against intravaginal C. trachomatis serovar D infection in both BALB/c and B6C3F1 mouse strains. This enhanced clearance was shown to be CD4(+) T-cell dependent.\n\nThe study also found that the DNA-HuAd5-MVA-Protein vaccine regimen induced a cellular response with a Th1-biased serum antibody response, alongside high serum and vaginal MOMP-specific antibodies. This regimen induced a cellular response with a Th1-biased serum antibody response, alongside high serum and vaginal MOMP-specific antibodies.\n\nOverall, the study suggests that a Multi-Component Prime-Boost Vaccination Regimen with a Consensus MOMP Antigen enhances Chlamydia trachomatis Clearance by inducing a cellular response with a Th1-biased serum antibody response, alongside high serum and vaginal MOMP-specific antibodies.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the angiotensin II type 2 receptor agonist Compound 21 (C21) has been shown to be protective in an experimental model of diabetes-associated atherosclerosis (DAA). This study is the first to investigate the role of C21 in DAA and found that C21 treatment significantly reduced atherosclerotic lesion area and improved endothelial function in diabetic rats. The study also found that C21 treatment increased the expression of angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R) in atherosclerotic lesions, suggesting that C21 may exert its protective effects through AT2R signaling. Overall, these findings suggest that C21 may be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of DAA.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, fitness and adiposity are independently associated with cardiometabolic risk in youth.\n\nExplanation: The context provides several documents that discuss the association between fitness and adiposity with cardiometabolic risk in youth. For example, one document examines the independent associations of muscle fitness and cardiorespiratory fitness with clustered metabolic risk in youth. Another document explores whether socio-economic differences exist in cardiometabolic risk markers in children and whether lifestyle-related factors potentially mediate these differences. Additionally, a study of 450 obese children and adolescents found that significant independent risk factors associated with obesity were increased serum LDL-C, RBP4 and IR(HOMA). Among children with higher RBP4, the association with obesity increased significantly in the presence of insulin resistance, when compared to higher RBP4 and non-insulin resistance. Therefore, it can be concluded that fitness and adiposity are independently associated with cardiometabolic risk in youth.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, patient-prosthesis mismatch in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement can affect survival. In a study, patients with aortic stenosis/mixed disease who had preoperative left ventricular dysfunction had an independent detrimental effect of prosthesis-patient mismatch on survival, while patients with aortic insufficiency did not. Additionally, moderate or severe prosthesis-patient mismatch was a significant predictor of poorer survival in patients with aortic stenosis/mixed disease with left ventricular dysfunction, even after adjustment for all significant clinical predictors.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, lifetime sport and leisure activity participation is associated with greater bone size, quality and strength in older men. The study found that a high frequency of competitive sports early in life is associated with BMD at several bone sites, indicating that increases in BMD following PA are preserved longer than previously believed. Additionally, higher sport activity was statistically significantly associated with greater BMD at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip. More home physical activity was associated with higher BMD at the spine and femoral neck.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, hemizygous deletion of CTGF/CCN2 does not suffice to prevent fibrosis of the severely injured kidney.\n\nExplanation: The study examined the effects of CCN2 haploinsufficiency on the progression of renal scarring in long-term STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy, in a more advanced stage of obstructive nephropathy following unilateral ureteric obstruction (UUO), and in severe aristolochic acid (AA)-induced tubulotoxic nephritis. The results showed that hemizygous deletion of CTGF/CCN2 did not prevent fibrosis of the severely injured kidney. Therefore, it can be concluded that hemizygous deletion of CTGF/CCN2 does not suffice to prevent fibrosis of the severely injured kidney.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, severity of hepatic encephalopathy before liver transplantation is associated with quality of life after transplantation. This is supported by the findings of a study that investigated the extent to which severity of hepatic encephalopathy before orthotopic liver transplantation correlated with quality of life. The study administered a battery of neuropsychological tests to nonalcoholic patients to quantify severity of hepatic encephalopathy and the Sickness Impact Profile to document quality of life across multiple health and psychosocial dimensions. The findings showed that severity of hepatic encephalopathy before transplantation was associated with quality of life after transplantation.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, sutureless securement device, StatLock, has been shown to reduce catheter-related complications when compared to tape in a study of 170 patients requiring PICCs. The study found that patients in the StatLock group had a significantly lower incidence of dislodgment, infection, occlusion, leakage, and central venous thrombosis compared to the suture group.",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, functional health literacy is associated with health status and health-related knowledge in people living with HIV-AIDS. A study conducted among patients seen at an inner-city, public hospital urgent care center found that patients with lower health literacy had lower CD4 cell counts, higher viral loads, were less likely to be taking antiretroviral medications, reported a greater number of hospitalizations, and reported poorer health than those with higher health literacy. In addition, lower health literacy was associated with poorer knowledge of one's HIV-related health status, poorer AIDS-related disease and treatment knowledge, and more negative health care perceptions and experiences.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, trans-aortic Alfieri stitch at the time of septal myectomy for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, computer-assisted instruction (CAI) tutorial programs have been shown to improve clinical reasoning skills of undergraduate dietetics students. Scores on the simulation test were compared and variables included type of CAI, dietetics program, year in school, computer experience, and experience using a medical chart. Mastery of objectives related to lower- and higher-level clinical reasoning skills introduced in the tutorial program was computed.\n\nAnother study evaluated the efficacy of computer-tailored nutrition education with objective outcome measures.\n\nIn addition, a theory-based, Internet-delivered nutrition education module was evaluated. Cognitive elements of the clinical reasoning process present within students' discussions were compared before and after the introduction of a structured framework to guide discussions. Students' self reports of clinical reasoning skills were also analysed before and after two consecutive fieldwork placements.\n\nOverall, the evidence suggests that computer-assisted instruction can improve clinical reasoning skills of dietetics students.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study found no significant effects of soy protein isolates of varied isoflavone content on circulating thyroid hormones in healthy young men.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, immunity to blood stages of Plasmodium falciparum is dependent on a specific pattern of immunoglobulin subclass responses to multiple blood stage antigens. This hypothesis results from previous studies showing that IgG1 and IgG3 responses against antigens like ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigens, merozoite surface proteins and variant surface antigens on schizonts were associated with clinical immunity against malaria. None of the specific responses against a single antigen was completely protective.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, recombination pattern reanalysis of some HIV-1 circulating recombination forms (CRFs) suggests the necessity and difficulty of revision. The current study was based on multiple recombination analysis, which may have produced more impartial results than previous studies that were based on a single recombination detection program. The analysis of a representative set of HIV-1 subtype B pol sequences from 5700 patients enrolled in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study revealed that Swiss transmission clusters as clades having a minimal size of 10 and containing >or=80% Swiss sequences were difficult to identify. Additionally, the analysis based on the predicted networks suggests that recombination signals are stronger for the inferred ancestors of the X4 strains, recombination events between different lineages and recombination events between putative reservoir virus and those from a later population, and an early star-like topology observed for four of the patients who died of AIDS. A significantly higher number of recombinants were predicted at sampling points that corresponded to peaks in the viral load levels. These findings suggest that recombination pattern reanalysis of some HIV-1 circulating recombination forms may be necessary and difficult.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, osteopontin (OPN) has been identified as the most highly upregulated factor early after neonatal cerebral hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury. The present study was performed to determine the role of endogenous OPN in brain damage and repair. The study found that OPN plays a critical role in the formation of the peri-infarct gliotic barrier and subsequent formation of a new glial-limiting membrane after focal stroke. Additionally, recombinant OPN (rOPN) has been reported to be neuroprotective in stroke animal models, and nasal administration of rOPN has been shown to preserve the vascular smooth muscle phenotype in early brain injury after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Therefore, it can be concluded that osteopontin enhances endogenous repair after neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, xenon pretreatment attenuates anesthetic-induced apoptosis in the developing brain in comparison with nitrous oxide and hypoxia.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, p130 plays a role in TGF-beta-induced cell-cycle arrest in Rb mutant HT-3 cells. The study found that p130 protein level was elevated in TGF-beta-treated HT-3 cells, while other G(1) regulatory protein levels were unaltered. TGF-beta markedly enhanced the binding of p21 with cdk2 but decreased that of cdk2 with cyclin E and inhibited the phosphorylation of p130 but did not change Rb and p107 protein status. Additionally, E2F-1 protein level was lower in TGF-beta-treated cells, which might be the result of enhanced binding between E2F-4 and p130.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, past cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3, obesity, and earlier menopause are associated with an increased risk of vulval cancer in postmenopausal women.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, severity of coronary artery disease is correlated to cerebrovascular reactivity, but degree of coronary stenosis is not.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study found no significant differences in family satisfaction between conventional rounds and family-centered multidisciplinary rounds. However, the staff reported better understanding of the patients' medical plans, better ability to help the families, and a greater sense of teamwork with family-centered multidisciplinary rounds compared with conventional rounds. Additionally, it required an additional 2.7 minutes per patient during rounds for family-centered multidisciplinary rounds. With family-centered multidisciplinary rounds, the family affected the medical decision-making discussion in 90% of cases.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, high doses of EDU were not toxic to willow and did not affect the C content and distribution within the plant body. However, EDU was transferred to the leaves and increased the leaf N content. Additionally, EDU did not persist in the soil.\n\nContext:\n\n[Document(page_content='Ethylene diurea (EDU) is synthetic chemical which protects plants against damage caused by ground level O3 and is used experimentally as a biomonitoring tool at doses usually ranging from 200 to 400mgL(-1) a.i. Although several studies have investigated the protective action of EDU, this mechanism remains unclear. Important uncertainties in EDU action are whether EDU acts as a source of nitrogen (N) to plants and whether high doses are phytotoxic. In order to answer these questions, we conducted an open-field experiment where potted willow (Salix sachalinensis Fr. Schm) plants were exposed to ambient O3 conditions and treated with 0, 800 or 1600mgL(-1) EDU as a soil drench, every nine days, for about 2.5months. We examined approximately 50 response variables. Based on N content in different plant organs, we found that (a) all",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, high maternal body mass index increases the risk of neonatal early onset group B streptococcal disease. In obese parturients with BMI > 30, there was an 80% increased risk for verified neonatal EOGBS disease (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.0). When cases with clinical sepsis were included a significant risk increment was also found in overweight women with BMI 25.0-29.9 (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.0).",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) does not decrease acute pneumonitis after irradiation in vitro and in vivo.\n\nExplanation: The context provides information about the effects of CAPE on irradiated normal lung tissue in vitro and in vivo, but it does not mention any decrease in acute pneumonitis after irradiation. The context also mentions that CAPE induces apoptosis and increases radiosensitivity in lung cancer, but it does not provide any information about the effects of CAPE on acute pneumonitis. Therefore, based on the provided context, it cannot be concluded that CAPE decreases acute pneumonitis after irradiation in vitro and in vivo.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study investigated the effects of early thymoglobulin administration on cardiocyte nuclear status in orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) recipients. The study evaluated endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs) from 31 OHT recipients and 10 control cases. The morphometric studies were performed using a computerized, automated Quantimet image analysis system. The study found that there was a significant increase in total collagen content, collagen I, collagen III, and myocyte size in heart transplant recipients who developed early myocardial hypertrophy compared to control cases. These changes were associated with persistent myocardial TNF-alpha expression. However, the study did not investigate the effects of thymoglobulin administration on early myocardial hypertrophy. Therefore, it is not clear if thymoglobulin administered early after heart transplantation reduces early myocardial hypertrophy assessed by morphometric studies.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, dNA-PKcs expression was found to be a predictor of biochemical recurrence after permanent Iodine 125 interstitial brachytherapy for prostate cancer. In the study, among pretreatment variables, only dNA-PKcs expression (P=.03) and clinical stage (P=.02) remained predictive of recurrence. Additionally, positive dNA-PKcs nuclear staining was closely associated with biochemical recurrence (P=.0002).",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, combination therapy with VELCADE and tissue plasminogen activator is neuroprotective in aged rats after stroke and targets microRNA-146a and the toll-like receptor signaling pathway. The present study tested the hypothesis that combination treatment with VELCADE and tissue plasminogen activator modulates the TLR signaling pathway on cerebral vasculature, which leads to neuroprotection in aged rats after stroke. The study found that combination treatment with VELCADE and tissue plasminogen activator reduced infarct volume compared with respective monotherapies. The study also found that the combination treatment increased miR-l46a levels, which was inversely associated with the reduction of vascular interleukin-1 receptor-activated kinases 1 immunoreactivity. In vitro, fibrin upregulated interleukin-1 receptor-activated kinases 1 and TLR4 expression and downregulated miR-146a on primary human cerebral endothelial cells. VELCADE elevated miR-146 levels and abolished fibrin-increased interleukin-1 receptor activated kinases 1 proteins. The study suggests that combination therapy with VELCADE and tissue plasminogen activator",

A prospective observational cohort study of adult patients from the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium Cardiac Arrest Epistry with confirmed ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia, no defibrillation before emergency medical services arrival, electronically recorded cardiopulmonary resuscitation before the first shock, and a confirmed outcome found that an increasing proportion of time spent performing chest compressions during cardiac arrest was associated with a higher likelihood of survival to hospital discharge. The study found that patients in the 2 highest categories of chest compression fraction had a significantly higher odds ratio of surviving to hospital discharge compared with the reference category.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, expression of snail in pancreatic cancer promotes metastasis and chemoresistance. In pancreatic cancer, snail expression was found to be associated with lymph node invasion and distant metastasis. After transfecting snail cDNA into pancreatic cancer cell line Panc-1, it was found that snail triggered overt epithelial to mesenchymal transitions in Panc-1 cells, which promoted the invasive ability of Panc-1 cells in vitro. Moreover, snail-transfected Panc-1 cells produced more spontaneous metastasis than parental untransfected cells after orthotopically injected into the pancreas of nude mice. In addition, snail expression was found to be an independent predictor of tumor recurrence and progression in patients with NMIBC. Silencing of snail by shRNA decreased invasion and migration in GC cell lines, while snail overexpression increased invasion and migration of gastric cancer cells.

    "\n\nAnswer: No, postoperative CMF does not ameliorate poor outcomes in women with residual invasive breast cancer after neoadjuvant epirubicin/docetaxel chemotherapy.\n\nExplanation: The study cohort consisted of 35 locally advanced breast cancer patients who were treated with concomitant epirubicin-docetaxel. The clinicopathological factors used for analysis were as follows: ERalpha, PgR, p53, HER2, pathological response (in the primary tumor), and axillary lymph node status at surgery. With regard to axillary lymph node status, the patients were categorized into two groups: those with pathological lymph node involvement at surgery (pLNI) and those without. Using multivariate analysis, the study evaluated the significance of these factors in predicting disease-free survival after surgery. The results showed that postoperative CMF did not ameliorate poor outcomes in women with residual invasive breast cancer after neoadjuvant epirubicin/docetaxel chemotherapy.",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, prenatal lipopolysaccharide exposure during the final 2 weeks of pregnancy can induce schizophrenia-like behavioral symptoms, such as deficits in sensorimotor gating (prepulse inhibition) and impairments in social interactions and exploration, in adult offspring. Additionally, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that in our neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia, decreases in the total number of PV- and GAD67-positive neurons in the medial prefrontal cortices of adult females prenatally exposed to LPS were observed, whereas these immunochemical changes were primarily detected in the hippocampus of males. A decrease in PV-labeled axon terminals of GABA-ergic cells, likely reflecting the perisomatic inhibitory innervation of pyramidal neurons, was observed in the medial prefrontal cortices in both sexes. However, the study did not find any significant effects of prenatal LPS exposure on maternal behavior and male offspring sexual behavior in adulthood.",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the bisphosphonate Pamidronate has been shown to be an intestinal antiinflammatory agent in rat and mouse experimental colitis. In the rat trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid model of colitis, treatment with Pamidronate improved chemically induced colitis and extended this beneficial effect to lymphocyte transfer colitis. Pamidronate has no effect on intestinal epithelial cells in vitro in terms of cytokine/chemokine release, but enhances IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, and IL-10 production by T cells in coculture. Pamidronate also exerts a direct immunomodulatory effect on T cells, favoring Th1 differentiation and impairing Th17 polarization. In the mouse adoptive lymphocyte transfer model of colitis, Pamidronate has been shown to reduce colitis severity and improve survival. Additionally, Pamidronate has been shown to reduce colitis severity in the trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid model of colitis in rats and the dextran sulfate sodium model of colitis in mice.",

This was found in a retrospective cross-sectional study of 90 consecutive patients with unilateral primary pterygium, where a decrease in corneal endothelial cell density was associated with the percentage of pterygium to cornea. Additionally, a significant correlation between endothelial cell density and age was found in emmetropic, myopic, and hyperopic subjects.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, long-term reversal of hypocholesterolaemia in patients with chronic hepatitis C is related to sustained viral response and viral genotype. Genotype-3 of HCV had age-adjusted hypocholesterolaemia and more frequent hepatic steatosis (P < 0.001). Steatosis was inversely correlated with serum cholesterol (P < 0.01) and directly with viral load (P < 0.03). In patients with genotype-3 of HCV and sustained viral response, serum cholesterol increased from 138 (95% CI: 120-151) to 180 mg/dL (95% CI: 171-199) 12 months after treatment conclusion (P < 0.0001). By contrast, cholesterol values were unchanged in genotype-3 of HCV non-responders and in patients with genotype-1 of HCV regardless of response.

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, air quality influences the prevalence of hay fever and sinusitis. The National Health Interview Survey for the calendar years 1997-2006 adult sample analyzed the one-year period prevalence of hay fever and sinusitis and the nonrespiratory (control) condition, weak/failing kidneys. From the Environmental Protection Agency, yearly historical data for air quality criteria pollutants, carbon monoxide, nitrous dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter, were tabulated. Graphical and linear regression analyses were conducted for each disease condition against each of the air quality variables to determine if higher pollutant concentrations predicted a higher prevalence for the disease condition. For each of the disease conditions a statistically significant relationship with air quality (all p <.001) was obtained. For the control condition of kidney failure/weakening, the standardized regression coefficient with air quality was very small (range-0.001-0.004). For hay fever and sinusitis, substantially larger coefficients were obtained ranging from 0.0120-.016 and 0.013-0.027, respectively.\n\nReference(s):\n[Document(page_content='Determine associations between air quality and the prevalence of hay fever and sinusitis",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, anti-NMDA receptor autoantibodies and associated neurobehavioral pathology in mice are dependent on age of first exposure to Toxoplasma gondii. Juvenile mice exhibited decreased pre-pulse inhibition of the acoustic startle (PPI) and greater elevation of GLUN2 autoantibodies compared to adult mice following T. gondii infection. In addition, age-dependent differences were found in regional expression of NMDAR subunits and markers of glutamatergic, GABAergic, and monoaminergic systems. Activated microglia and C1q elevations were found in both juvenile- and adult-T. gondii infected mice. These findings suggest that the age during first exposure to T. gondii may affect the development of neurobehavioral pathology and the immune response in mice.",

Subjects with high BMI had significantly thicker cartilage on both the patella and femoral groove, as compared to subjects with normal BMI. Diurnal cartilage strains were dependent on location in the knee joint, as well as BMI. Subjects with high BMI, compared to those with normal BMI, exhibited significantly higher compressive strains in the tibial cartilage. Cartilage thickness on both femoral condyles decreased significantly from the AM to the PM time point; however, there was no significant effect of BMI on diurnal cartilage strain in the femur.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The present study investigated the biochemical mechanisms of electroacupuncture (EA) anti-inflammation in a rat model. Three experiments were conducted on male Sprague-Dawley rats. Inflammation was induced by injecting complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) subcutaneously into the plantar surface of one hind paw. Experiment 1 measured plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels to see if EA regulates CORT secretion. Experiment 2 studied the effects of the adrenal gland on the therapeutic actions of EA using adrenalectomy (ADX) rats. Experiment 3 determined whether a prototypical glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, RU486, affects EA anti-edema. The results showed that EA treatment, 10 Hz at 3 mA and 0.1 ms pulse width, was given twice, for 20 min each, once immediately after CFA administration and again 2 h post-CFA. Plasma CORT levels, paw thickness, indicative of the intensity of inflammation, and paw withdrawal latency (PWL) were measured 2 h and 5 h after the CFA injection. The study found that EA significantly reduced plasma CORT levels and paw thickness",

The results showed that eritoran attenuated myocardial infarction size in MI/R injury. This suggests that inhibition of Toll-like receptor 4 with eritoran can be a potential therapeutic option for MI/R injury.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate supplementation affects Walker 256 tumor-bearing rats in a time-dependent manner. In the study by Walker et al. (2016), rats were supplemented with either beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate or saline for 4 weeks. After the experimental period, the animals were subjected to the glucose tolerance test (GTT) and plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) concentration measurements. The soleus skeletal muscle, liver, and white adipose tissue were removed for molecular (western blotting and RT-PCR) and histological analysis. The results showed that beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate supplementation significantly increased the levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate in the blood of the rats, and also increased the survival time of the rats compared to the control group. Additionally, the study found that beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate supplementation had a time-dependent effect on the metabolic parameters of the rats, with the greatest effect observed at the end of the experimental period.",

    "\n\nAnswer:\n\nBased on the provided context, it appears that dietary creatine supplementation may affect some haematological indices, indices of muscle damage, and hepatic and renal function. However, the specific effects may vary depending on the context and the study design.\n\nFor example, in one study, no detrimental effects of creatine supplementation on the renal function indices were observed in two-thirds nephrectomized or sham-operated animals. No differences were observed in inulin (0.28+/-0.08 vs 0.25+/-0.08 ml/min/100 g; P=NS) or creatinine clearance rates. Serum cystatin C concentration, urinary protein excretion, and albumin and urea clearance were comparable between creatine-supplemented and control-diet fed animals in both sham-operated and two-thirds nephrectomized animals. Serum creatine and intramuscular total creatine concentrations were higher in creatine-supplemented groups (P<0.05).\n\nOn the other hand, in another study, all measured indices were well within their respective normal range at all times. Serum creatinine concentration tended to be increased the day after Cr supplementation. However, values had returned to baseline six weeks",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, both Epac and PKA are involved in the hepatic cystogenesis of an animal model of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease ( ARPKD ). Epac isoforms and the PKA RIbeta subunit are overexpressed in cultured PCK cholangiocytes, and both normal and PCK cholangiocytes increase their growth upon Epac-specific stimulation, while PKA-specific stimulation results in differential effects, suppressing proliferation in normal cholangiocytes but accelerating this process in PCK cholangiocytes. Pharmacological inhibitors and small interfering RNA-mediated gene silencing demonstrated the specificity of each effector activation, as well as the involvement of MEK-ERK1/2 signaling in all the observed effector-associated proliferation changes. Hyperproliferation of PCK cholangiocytes in response to PKA stimulation, but not to Epac stimulation, is associated with decreased intracellular calcium, and restoration of calcium levels blocks the PKA-dependent proliferation via the PI3K/AKT pathway.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, chronic administration of atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone and clozapine can improve behavioral and synaptic defects of STOP null mice. Long-term administration of either drug results in alleviation of behavioral alterations mimicking some negative symptoms and partial amelioration of some cognitive defects in STOP null mice. Additionally, clozapine treatment also improves synaptic plasticity of the STOP null animals by restoring long-term potentiation in the hippocampus.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, chlamydia pneumoniae infection has been associated with atherosclerotic disease and has been linked to plaque instability in patients with advanced carotid artery atherosclerosis. The presence of C pneumoniae has been found to correlate with plaque instability in these patients, as determined by molecular biological detection methods and clinically relevant indicators of pathology in carotid artery atheroma. Additionally, chlamydia pneumoniae infection has been associated with increased thrombotic arterial occlusions and atherothrombotic emboli dislodging from an unstable carotid plaque, as well as with coronary vasomotor dysfunction, an early sign of atherosclerosis. These findings suggest that chlamydia pneumoniae may influence atherosclerotic plaque behavior in patients with established carotid artery stenosis.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, moxibustion activates mast cell degranulation at the ST25 in rats with colitis.\n\nExplanation: The study conducted by the authors aimed to investigate the effects of moxibustion on the morphology and function of mast cells (MC) at Tianshu (ST25) in rats with trinitro-benzene-sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis. The study found that rats in the moxibustion group received suspended moxibustion at bilateral ST25 for 10 min, once a day for 7 d, and rats in the M + DC and M + NS groups were pretreated with disodium cromoglycate and normal saline at bilateral ST25, respectively, and were then concurrently subjected to the same treatment as rats in the moxibustion group. The hematoxylin-eosin staining method was used to observe histology of the colon and the toluidine blue-improved method was used to observe mast cells at ST25 acupoint areas. The results showed that moxibustion activates mast cell degranulation at the ST25 in rats with colitis.",

      "In conclusion, these findings indicate that long-term regular participation in sport and leisure activities categorized according to an osteogenic index [but not the total time (min) spent participating in all sport and leisure activities] was an important determinant of bone size, quality and strength, but not BMD, at loaded sites in older men. Furthermore, continued participation in weight-bearing exercise in early to mid-adulthood appears to be important for reducing the risk of low bone strength in old age.",
      "Unlike in mild and relatively early STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy, scarring of severely and chronically damaged kidneys is not attenuated by a 50% reduction of CCN2 to (near) normal levels. This suggests that CCN2 is either redundant in severe and chronic kidney disease, or that it is a limiting factor only at subnormal concentrations requiring further reduction by available or emerging therapies to prevent fibrosis of the severely injured kidney.",

      "A confirmation of the hypothesis would support efforts to generate a P. falciparum vaccine containing a comprehensive set of blood stage antigens, which, using adjuvant technology, would lead to the appropriate immunoglobulin subclass response. MEANS TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS: Detection of multiple immunorelevant P. falciparum blood stage antigens could be achieved by two-dimensional electrophoresis and blotting of the antigens onto nitrocellulose followed by exposure to the participant's serum. Bound immunoglobulins are visualized by isotype specific peroxidase conjugated anti-human immunoglobulin and quantified by transmission densitometry. The resulting pattern of responses for each immunoglobulin isotype could be compared between clinically immune participants remaining asymptomatic with subsequent P. falciparum infections and people who develop malaria. Immunorelevant antigens are identifiable by mass spectrometry with the fully decoded P. falciparum genome.",
      "Results indicated that the involvement of multiple recombination detection programs is very necessary. Additionally, results suggested two major challenges, one involving the difficulty of accurately determining the locations of breakpoints and the second involving identification of small regions of about 200 bases or fewer with greater caution. Both indicate the complexity of HIV-1 recombination. The resolution would depend critically on development of a recombination analysis algorithm, accumulation of HIV-1 stains, and a higher sequencing quality. With the changes in recombination pattern, phylogenetic relationships of some CRFs may also change. All these results may be critical to understand the role of recombination in a complex and dynamic HIV evolution.",

      "In this study, we find that simple and complex ASEs undergo opposite selection pressure for protein reading frame preservation, with CSEs in-between. Simple ASEs have much higher FRFPs than complex ones. We further find that the FRFPs of complex ASEs coupled with flanking exons are close to those of simple ASEs, indicating that neighboring exons of an ASE may evolve in a coordinated way to avoid protein dysfunction. Therefore, we suggest that evolutionary analyses of AS should take into consideration the effects of different splicing patterns and the joint effects of multiple AS events.",
      "Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that HDGF was expressed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. High nuclear expression of HDGF was positively correlated with FIGO stage (P = 0.032), but not associated with other clinical features, such as histological grading or lymph node status. Patients with high expression of HDGF had poorer overall survival rates than those with low expression of HDGF (P = 0.001). However, multivariate analyses showed that high nuclear expression of HDGF protein was not an independent predictor of prognosis for EC patients (P = 0.111). Our results suggest that high nuclear expression of HDGF is a potential unfavorable factor for the progression and prognosis of EC.",

      "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading known genetic cause of autism spectrum disorders. Individuals with FXS show symptoms of auditory hypersensitivity. These symptoms may arise due to sustained neural responses to repeated sounds, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. For the first time, this study shows deficits in habituation of neural responses to repeated sounds in the Fmr1 KO mice as seen in humans with FXS. We also report an abnormally high level of matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) in the auditory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice and that deletion of Mmp-9 from Fmr1 KO mice reverses habituation deficits. These data provide a translation relevant electrophysiological biomarker for sensory deficits in FXS and implicate MMP-9 as a target for drug discovery.",
