    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is characterized by dynamic impairment of active relaxation and contraction of the left ventricle on exercise and associated with myocardial energy deficiency.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, soluble ( Pro ) Renin Receptor has been shown to be a predictor of gestational diabetes mellitus. A study published in the journal \"Diabetes Care\" found that circulating Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) is activated during normal pregnancy, but little is known about RAS in pregnancies complicated by gestational diabetes (GDM). The study evaluated the circulating RAS profile in normotensive women with GDM at the third trimester of pregnancy and compared the results with healthy pregnant and non-pregnant age-matched women. The results showed that soluble ( Pro ) Renin Receptor levels were significantly higher in women with GDM compared to healthy pregnant and non-pregnant women. Additionally, the study found that soluble ( Pro ) Renin Receptor levels were positively associated with the risk of developing GDM.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, obvious emphysema on computed tomography during an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is associated with a poor prognosis.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the study found that levels of both genital mucosal and blood chemokines were compared between HIV-1-uninfected and HIV-1-infected female commercial sex workers (CSWs) as well as HIV-1-uninfected non-CSW control women at low risk for exposure, recruited in Cotonou, Benin. The study also found that cytokine/chemokine concentrations and the percent of tissue staining positive for T cells were compared using generalized estimating equations between non-shedding and shedding visits across all women and within a subgroup of women who intermittently shed HIV-1.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the provided context describes pathological observations of lung injury in experimental animals induced by non-ferrous metal ( tin ) dust. The observations include scattered hoar tip size of the spots in surface and section of the lungs, scattered focal granulomatous inflammation around the small bronchi and dust particles in lung tissue, granulomatous inflammation increase, fibroblasts proliferation, collagen fibers formation and positive VG staining on the 90th day after exposure to tin dusts, bronchoalveolar inflammation, collagen fibrils increase, simple hyperplasia, papillary hyperplasia and metaplasia of the epithelial cells in alveolar and bronchi, atypical adenomatous hyperplasia and squamous dysplasia, and lung cancer induced in the end.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the study found that DNA methylation of the retinoid acid receptor beta (RARbeta), cellular retinol-binding protein 1 (CRBP1), and tazarotene-induced gene 1 (TIG1) genes was associated with gastric carcinoma (GC). In 7 of 8 GC cell lines, the CRBP1 gene was hypermethylated, and CRBP1 transcription was inactive. In 6 of 8 GC cell lines, the TIG1 gene was hypermethylated, and TIG1 transcription was inactive. Treatment with demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restored both CRBP1 and TIG1 transcription. DNA methylation of the RARbeta, CRBP1, and TIG1 genes was detected in 15 of 42 GC samples (36%), 14 of 42 GC samples (33%), and 4 of 42 GC samples (10%), respectively, and in 6 of 30 samples (20%), 0 of 30 samples (0%), and 1 of 30 samples (3%) of corresponding nonneoplastic mucosa. None of the 10 normal gastric mucosa samples from young, healthy",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, antiangiogenic therapy of cerebral melanoma metastases does not result in sustained tumor progression via vessel co-option. The study found that antiangiogenic treatment inhibits the progression of leptomeningeal tumors.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, clove and eugenol in noncytotoxic concentrations exert immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory action on cytokine production by murine macrophages. Clove (100\u00b5g/well) inhibited IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-10 production and exerted an efficient action either before or after LPS challenge for all cytokines. Eugenol did not affect IL-1\u03b2 production but inhibited IL-6 and IL-10 production. The action of eugenol (50 or 100\u00b5g/well) on IL-6 production prevented efficiently effects of LPS either before or after its addition, whereas on IL-10 production it counteracted significantly LPS action when added after LPS incubation.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, pretreatment with stellate ganglion blockade before ischemia does not reduce infarct size in rat hearts. The study found that there was no significant difference in infarct size between the preconditioned (P) group and the control group. However, the study did find that overexpression of Semaphorin 3a (Sema3a) within the left stellate ganglion (LSG) confers an antiarrhythmic effect after myocardial infarction (MI) through decreasing extra- and intra-cardiac neural remodelling.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, lipidomics reveals multiple pathway effects of a multi-components preparation on lipid biochemistry in ApoE*3Leiden.CETP mice. The preparation SUB885C caused significant reductions in plasma cholesterol, CETP levels, CETP activity, and increased HDL-C. It influenced lipidomics classes of cholesterol esters and triglycerides the most. In vitro, SUB885C extract caused adipolysis stimulation and adipogenesis inhibition in 3T3-L1 cells.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, elevated nm23 protein expression is not correlated with diminished progression-free survival in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, leukotriene B ( 4 ) enhances tumour necrosis factor-alpha-induced CCL27 production in human keratinocytes.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, hemoglobin levels do not predict biochemical outcome for localized prostate cancer treated with neoadjuvant androgen-suppression therapy and external-beam radiotherapy.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, the amount of visceral fat was not associated with the degree of fatty liver.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, induction of oral tolerance to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) attenuates the initiation and progression of atherogenesis in LDL receptor-/- mice fed a Western-type diet. This is achieved through an increase in CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ cells in spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes, which specifically respond to oxLDL with increased transforming growth factor-beta production. In contrast, tolerance to malondialdehyde-treated LDL (MDA-LDL) does not affect atherogenesis.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, a more atherogenic cholesterol distribution by insulin resistance was seen in women with type 1 diabetes.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the text states that almost 20% of angle procedures eventually fail, and surgeons are confronted with a choice of what procedure to do next: a trabeculectomy with or without adjunctive antifibrosis therapy, glaucoma drainage surgery, or cyclodestructive procedures.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the present study suggests that the beneficial effect of rosuvastatin on cardiac dysfunction in a rat model of cardiac dysfunction due to myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with alterations in calcium-regulatory proteins. The study found that rosuvastatin prevented the decrease of SERCA2a and pSer16-PLB expression, increased SERCA activity, and reduced the increased IL-6 level and further elevated IL-10 level in the peri-infarct and remote zones of MI. Additionally, the study found that superoxide dismutase activity in the rosuvastatin-treated group was higher than that of the control group, and serum levels of malondialdehyde were lower. These findings suggest that rosuvastatin may have a protective effect on cardiac function by regulating calcium-regulatory proteins and reducing oxidative stress.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, prolonged resuscitation of metabolic acidosis after trauma is associated with more complications. In the study, patients with persistent metabolic acidosis developed MOF at a significantly greater rate than did normal weight patients with or without persistent metabolic acidosis. Additionally, the duration of metabolic crisis was longer in those patients with unfavorable (GOSe \u2264 6) versus favorable (GOSe \u2265 7) outcome at 6 months. In four multivariate models, the burden of metabolic crisis was a powerful independent predictor of poor outcome.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, nSC23925 has been shown to prevent the development of multidrug resistance in osteosarcoma cells in vitro. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of nSC23925 on the prevention of multidrug resistance in ovarian cancer, especially in vivo.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, restoration of klotho expression induces apoptosis and autophagy in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, leukocytosis is proportional to HELLP syndrome severity. Patients with HELLP syndrome had significantly higher white blood cell counts than patients with severe preeclampsia alone. Regression analysis showed that platelet counts varied inversely with white blood cell counts. Additionally, patients with class I HELLP syndrome had significantly higher white blood cell counts than patients with other classes of HELLP syndrome. The changes found in normal pregnancy and preeclampsia were similar, but not identical, to those found in sepsis. The study used flow cytometry to evaluate changes in leukocyte markers in preeclampsia compared with uncomplicated pregnancy and monitored the NF-kappaB signal transduction pathway. Plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) were also studied as an additional indication of cellular activation. The aim of the study was to seek evidence for circulating leukocyte activation in preeclampsia.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, the provided context does not mention pancreatic head carcinoma or pN2. It only mentions decoy receptor 3 ( DcR3 ) expression and its association with clinicopathologic features and prognoses in patients with renal cell carcinomas ( RCCs ).",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, a Multi-Component Prime-Boost Vaccination Regimen with a Consensus MOMP Antigen enhances Chlamydia trachomatis Clearance. The DNA-HuAd5-MVA-Protein vaccine regimen induced a cellular response with a Th1-biased serum antibody response, alongside high serum and vaginal MOMP-specific antibodies. This regimen significantly enhanced clearance against intravaginal C. trachomatis serovar D infection in both BALB/c and B6C3F1 mouse strains. This enhanced clearance was shown to be CD4(+) T-cell dependent.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the study suggests that Compound 21 (C21) may contribute to insulin-sensitizing/anti-diabetic effects in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) with PPAR\u03b3 activation, mainly focusing on adipose tissue. However, the study did not directly investigate the protective effects of C21 in experimental diabetes-associated atherosclerosis.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, fitness and adiposity are independently associated with cardiometabolic risk in youth. Several studies have examined the association between fitness and clustered cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in children and adolescents from different countries. For example, a cross-sectional study examined the association between fitness and clustered CVD risk in children and adolescents from three European countries. Similarly, a study examined the independent association of total and central body fat and cardiorespiratory fitness with markers of insulin resistance in European adolescents participating in the HELENA-CSS (Healthy Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence Cross-Sectional) study. Additionally, a study defined the relationships between peak aerobic capacity, body composition, and fasting insulin levels in nonobese middle school children. Overall, these studies suggest that fitness and adiposity are independently associated with cardiometabolic risk in youth.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, patient-prosthesis mismatch in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement is associated with poorer survival. This was observed in a study where the degree of prosthesis-patient mismatch was minimal in 57% of patients, moderate in 39%, and severe in 4%. During a median follow-up period of approximately 7.9 years, overall survival was 77% in patients with minimal mismatch, 63% in those with moderate mismatch, and only 47% in those with severe mismatch (P <.001). Moderate or severe mismatch was a significant predictor of poorer survival (hazard ratio, 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-2.3; P <.01), even after adjustment for all significant clinical predictors (ie, propensity score; hazard ratio, 1.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.5; P =.05).",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the study found that a high frequency of competitive sports early in life is associated with bone mineral density (BMD) at several bone sites, indicating that increases in BMD following physical activity (PA) are preserved longer than previously believed. The study also found that higher sport activity was statistically significantly associated with greater BMD at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip. More home physical activity was associated with higher BMD at the spine and femoral neck. However, work physical activity and active living were not related to BMD at any bone site.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, hemizygous deletion of CTGF/CCN2 does not suffice to prevent fibrosis of the severely injured kidney. The study examined the effects of CCN2 haploinsufficiency on the progression of renal scarring in long-term STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy, in a more advanced stage of obstructive nephropathy following unilateral ureteric obstruction (UUO), and in severe aristolochic acid (AA)-induced tubulotoxic nephritis. The results showed that CCN2 haploinsufficiency did not prevent fibrosis of the severely injured kidney.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, severity of hepatic encephalopathy before liver transplantation is associated with quality of life after transplantation. This is because hepatic encephalopathy has a negative impact on health-related quality of life (QoL) in liver cirrhosis, and it has been observed that overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is accompanied by a persistent cognitive defect, suggesting that HE may not be fully reversible. The health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) has been shown to be impaired by cirrhosis, and, according to some reports, influenced by minimal HE. Therefore, it is important to consider the severity of hepatic encephalopathy before liver transplantation as a factor that may affect quality of life after transplantation.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, sutureless securement device, StatLock, has been shown to reduce catheter-related complications when compared to tape in earlier studies. In this study, 170 patients requiring PICCs were randomized to suture or StatLock securement, and patients were followed throughout their entire catheter course. PICC-related complications including dislodgment, infection, occlusion, leakage, and central venous thrombosis were documented. Catheter outcome data were compared to determine if statistically significant differences existed between the suture and StatLock groups. The results showed that StatLock significantly reduced catheter-related complications compared to suture.\n\nIn addition, sutureless anastomosis has been demonstrated to have better hemodynamics at the venous outflow with a supposed reduction of venous neointimal hyperplasia (VNH), which is responsible for outflow stenosis and access thrombosis. This may potentially improve graft patency.\n\nIt is important to note that while sutureless securement device may reduce complications, it is not a guarantee of complete prevention. Other factors such as multiple failed hemodialysis access and poor vascular anatomy can also contribute to complications.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, attachment of synovial fibroblasts (SFs) to laminin-111 did not activate the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), but addition of transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) induced a fivefold higher expression of MMP-3. Incubation of SF on LM-111 in the presence of TGFbeta induced a significant 12-fold higher expression of MMP-3 mRNA, and secretion of MMP-3 was elevated 20-fold above controls. Functional blocking of LM-111-integrin interaction reduced the laminin-activated MMP-3 expression significantly.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, functional health literacy is associated with health status and health-related knowledge in people living with HIV-AIDS. A study conducted on a community-recruited sample of 339 HIV-infected men and women found that patients with inadequate health literacy had lower HIV/AIDS knowledge scores than those with marginal or adequate health literacy. In addition, patients' REALM scores were positively associated with their HIV/AIDS knowledge even after adjusting for income, education, and risk perception. Another study conducted on a sample of 372 patients at an inner-city, public hospital urgent care center found that about 1 of 4 people living with HIV-AIDS demonstrated difficulty comprehending simple medical instructions and therefore lower health literacy. HIV-infected people with lower health literacy had lower CD4 cell counts, higher viral loads, were less likely to be taking antiretroviral medications, reported a greater number of hospitalizations, and reported poorer health than those with higher health literacy. Furthermore, after adjusting for years of formal education, lower health literacy was associated with poorer knowledge of one's HIV-related health status, poorer AIDS-related disease and treatment knowledge, and more negative health care perceptions and experiences.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the technique of placing an Alfieri stitch in the mitral valve through the aortotomy while performing septal myectomy for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy is described in the context.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, computer-assisted instruction (CAI) tutorial programs have been shown to improve clinical reasoning skills of undergraduate dietetics students. Scores on a simulation test were compared and variables included type of CAI, dietetics program, year in school, computer experience, and experience using a medical chart. Mastery of objectives related to lower- and higher-level clinical reasoning skills introduced in the tutorial program was computed. Additionally, a theory-based, Internet-delivered nutrition education module was evaluated and cognitive elements of the clinical reasoning process present within students' discussions were compared before and after the introduction of a structured framework to guide discussions. Students' self reports of clinical reasoning skills were also analyzed before and after two consecutive fieldwork placements. Finally, computer-tailored nutrition education was evaluated with objective outcome measures.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, soy protein isolates of varied isoflavone content can influence serum thyroid hormones in healthy young men. The study found that high-isoflavone soy protein isolate supplementation significantly decreased total triiodothyronine (T3) and free T3 levels, while low-isoflavone soy protein isolate supplementation had no significant effect on these hormones. Additionally, high-isoflavone soy protein isolate supplementation significantly decreased total thyroxine (T4) levels, while low-isoflavone soy protein isolate supplementation had no significant effect on this hormone.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, immunity to blood stages of Plasmodium falciparum is dependent on a specific pattern of immunoglobulin subclass responses to multiple blood stage antigens. This hypothesis results from previous studies showing that IgG1 and IgG3 responses against antigens like ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigens, merozoite surface proteins and variant surface antigens on schizonts were associated with clinical immunity against malaria. None of the specific responses against a single antigen was completely protective.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, reanalysis of some HIV-1 circulating recombination forms (CRFs) suggests the necessity and difficulty of revision. The current study was based on multiple recombination analysis, which may have produced more impartial results. Unlike previous studies, whose results are based primarily on a single recombination detection program, the current study was based on multiple recombination analysis, which may have produced more impartial results. Such revisions may also be necessary for other CRFs.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, osteopontin (OPN) is the most highly upregulated factor early after neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. The present study was performed to determine the role of endogenous OPN in brain damage and repair.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, xenon pretreatment attenuates anesthetic-induced apoptosis in the developing brain in comparison with nitrous oxide and hypoxia.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, p130 plays a role in TGF-beta-induced cell-cycle arrest in Rb mutant HT-3 cells. The study found that E2F-4 binds to p130 in TGF-beta-treated cells, which may lead to the downregulation of E2F-1 and the inhibition of cell proliferation. Additionally, the study found that p130 binds to cdk2 in TGF-beta-treated cells, which may contribute to the G(1) phase arrest.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, past cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3, obesity, and earlier menopause are associated with an increased risk of vulval cancer in postmenopausal women.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, severity of coronary artery disease is correlated to cerebrovascular reactivity, but degree of coronary stenosis is not.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study found no significant differences in family satisfaction between conventional rounds and family-centered multidisciplinary rounds. However, the staff reported better understanding of the patients' medical plans, better ability to help the families, and a greater sense of teamwork with family-centered multidisciplinary rounds compared with conventional rounds. Additionally, it required an additional 2.7 minutes per patient during rounds for family-centered multidisciplinary rounds. With family-centered multidisciplinary rounds, the family affected the medical decision-making discussion in 90% of cases.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, high doses of EDU were not toxic to willow and did not affect the C content and distribution within the plant body. However, EDU increased the leaf N content. Additionally, EDU was not persistent in the soil, as indicated by soil N content.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, high maternal body mass index increases the risk of neonatal early onset group B streptococcal disease. In obese parturients with BMI > 30, there was an 80% increased risk for verified neonatal EOGBS disease. When cases with clinical sepsis were included, a significant risk increment was also found in overweight women with BMI 25.0-29.9. Additionally, maternal and neonatal fT3 levels consistently increased with increasing maternal obesity, and maternal and neonatal fT3 were significantly correlated. Excess gestational weight gain was associated with a decrease in maternal fT4 compared with gravidae who had insufficient gestational weight gain.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) does not decrease acute pneumonitis after irradiation in vitro and in vivo. The study found that CAPE induces apoptosis and increases radiosensitivity in lung cancer, but it does not have a protective effect against acute pneumonitis.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study assessed the effects of early thymoglobulin administration on cardiocyte nuclear status in orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) recipients. The study investigated endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs) from 31 OHT recipients and 10 control cases. OHT patients were divided into the standard group who were treated without thymoglobulin; an ATG group who received thymoglobulin electively, and a standard+ATG group who were administered thymoglobulin upon a drop in renal function. The study evaluated only EMBs obtained at 1 and 4 weeks after OHT showing no significant rejection (ISHLT grades 0 to 1B). The morphometric studies were performed using a computerized, automated Quantimet image analysis system. The study found no significant difference in cardiocyte nuclear area, length, breadth, perimeter, chromatin median grey level, and fullness factor between the standard group, ATG group, and standard+ATG group. Therefore, the study did not find that thymoglobulin administered early after heart transplantation reduces early myocardial hypertrophy assessed by morphometric studies.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, dNA-PKcs expression was found to be a predictor of biochemical recurrence after permanent iodine 125 interstitial brachytherapy for prostate cancer. In the study, positive dNA-PKcs nuclear staining was closely associated with biochemical recurrence (P=.0002). On multivariate analysis, only the Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen level, and dNA-PKcs status remained predictive of recurrence (P=.003, P=.002, and P=.01, respectively).",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, chemotherapy for cancer can cause apoptosis that precedes hypoplasia in crypts of the small intestine in humans. This is evident from the following documents:\n\n- Document 1: \"Apoptosis increased sevenfold in intestinal crypts at one day, and villus area, crypt length, mitotic count per crypt, and enterocyte height decreased at three days after chemotherapy. Disaccharidase activities remained unchanged. Electron microscopy showed increased open tight junctions of enterocytes at day 3, consistent with more immature cells. All indices improved by 16 days.\"\n- Document 2: \"VSL#3 reduced weight loss following irinotecan when administered before and after chemotherapy. Moderate and severe diarrhea was also prevented in these rats. This was associated with a significant increase in crypt proliferation combined with an inhibition of apoptosis in both the small and large intestines. VSL#3 also prevented irinotecan-induced increases in goblet cells within jejunal crypts.\"\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the specific type of chemotherapy and its effects on apoptosis and hypoplasia may vary depending on the individual case and the specific drug being used.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, alveolar macrophage gene expression is altered in the setting of alcohol use disorders. Whole genome microarray analysis was performed on alveolar macrophages obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage from a test cohort of subjects with AUDs and controls who were pair-matched on age, gender, and smoking. Probe set expression differences in this cohort were validated by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT RT-PCR). Functional analysis with web-based bioinformatics tools was utilized with microarray data to assess differentially expressed candidate genes (p < 0.01) based on alcohol consumption. Alveolar macrophage mRNA samples from a second cohort of subjects with AUDs and controls were used to confirm gene expression differences related to AUDs.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, a diminished postnatal surge of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants is not additional evidence for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The study found that the number of Ad spermatogonia in unilateral cryptorchid testes correlated in a nonlinear fashion with those in the contralateral scrotal testes, indicating that the development of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants is not affected by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, female children were nearly three times more likely to be stunted than male children. Households that were food insecure with hunger were also three times more likely than other households to have a stunted child.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, combination therapy with VELCADE and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is neuroprotective in aged rats after stroke and targets microRNA-146a and the toll-like receptor signaling pathway. The study found that combination treatment with VELCADE and tPA modulates the TLR signaling pathway on cerebral vasculature, which leads to neuroprotection in aged rats after stroke. The study also found that the combination treatment increased miR-l46a levels, which was inversely associated with the reduction of vascular interleukin-1 receptor-activated kinases 1 immunoreactivity. In vitro, fibrin upregulated interleukin-1 receptor-activated kinases 1 and TLR4 expression and downregulated miR-146a on primary human cerebral endothelial cells. VELCADE elevated miR-146 levels and abolished fibrin-increased interleukin-1 receptor activated kinases 1 proteins.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, higher peak weight velocity (PWV) in infancy was associated with a significant decrease in spirometric lung function indices at 15 years of age.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, the provided context does not mention any in vivo study investigating the hepato-protective effects of garlic-derived S-allylmercaptocysteine in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The context only mentions a study investigating the antifibrotic effects of S-allylcysteine (SAC) in the liver.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the study found that an increasing proportion of time spent performing chest compressions during cardiac arrest was associated with a higher likelihood of survival to hospital discharge in patients with out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. The study also found that chest compression fraction was a significant predictor of survival to hospital discharge, with the highest category of chest compression fraction being associated with a 3.01-fold increased odds of survival compared with the reference category.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, expression of snail in pancreatic cancer promotes metastasis and chemoresistance. In the study, snail expression was found in 36% of pancreatic cancer samples and was closely correlated with lymph node invasion and distant metastasis. After transfecting snail cDNA into pancreatic cancer cell line Panc-1, snail triggered overt epithelial to mesenchymal transitions in Panc-1 cells, promoting the invasive ability of Panc-1 cells in vitro. Snail also enhanced the chemoresistance of Panc-1 cells to 5-fluorouracil and gemcitabine at different dosages. Moreover, snail-transfected Panc-1 cells produced more spontaneous metastasis than parental untransfected cells after orthotopically injected into the pancreas of nude mice.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, slug down-regulation by RNA interference inhibits invasion growth in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, postoperative CMF does not ameliorate poor outcomes in women with residual invasive breast cancer after neoadjuvant epirubicin/docetaxel chemotherapy.\n\nExplanation: The study cohort consisted of 35 locally advanced breast cancer patients who were treated with concomitant epirubicin-docetaxel. The clinicopathological factors used for analysis were as follows: ERalpha, PgR, p53, HER2, pathological response (in the primary tumor), and axillary lymph node status at surgery. With regard to axillary lymph node status, the study categorized patients into two groups: those with pathological lymph node involvement at surgery (pLNI) and those without. Using multivariate analysis, the study evaluated the significance of these factors in predicting disease-free survival after surgery.\n\nThe study found that postoperative CMF did not ameliorate poor outcomes in women with residual invasive breast cancer after neoadjuvant epirubicin/docetaxel chemotherapy. The study also found that age, ERalpha, PgR, p53, HER2, pathological response, and axillary lymph node status were significant predictors of disease-free survival after surgery.",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the hypothesis that inhibition of leukocyte function by administration of monoclonal antibody 60.3 (MoAb 60.3) improves electrophysiological recovery and decreases injury volume following transient focal cerebral ischemia in cats is supported by the provided context.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, prenatal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure affects maternal behavior and male offspring sexual behavior in adulthood. In the study, prenatal LPS exposure during the final 2 weeks of pregnancy induced schizophrenia-like behavioral symptoms, such as deficits in sensorimotor gating (prepulse inhibition) and impairments in social interactions and exploration, in adult offspring. Additionally, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that in the neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia, decreases in the total number of PV- and GAD67-positive neurons in the medial prefrontal cortices of adult females prenatally exposed to LPS were observed, whereas these immunochemical changes were primarily detected in the hippocampus of males. Furthermore, a decrease in PV-labeled axon terminals of GABA-ergic cells, likely reflecting the perisomatic inhibitory innervation of pyramidal neurons, was observed in the medial prefrontal cortices in both sexes.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (AFABP) levels were significantly elevated in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) versus control and correlated with indices of inflammation and fibrosis.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, according to the provided context, people with Alzheimer's disease had greater variability in stride timing and double support proportion during gait initiation compared to controls.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, as a pitcher approaches muscular fatigue during a simulated baseball game, pitching biomechanics may change, leading to a decrease in performance and an increased risk of injury. Specifically, as a pitcher approaches muscular fatigue, ball velocity decreases and the trunk becomes closer to a vertical position. Additionally, select pitching biomechanical variables will be significantly different than they were before muscular fatigue. A total of 99 pitchers were recruited for this study and underwent a pitching analysis using 3-dimensional motion analysis techniques. A random intercept mixed-effects regression model was used to determine if statistically significant associations existed between contralateral trunk lean (away from the pitching arm side) and ball velocity, as well as the elbow varus moment and glenohumeral internal rotation moment.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the bisphosphonate Pamidronate has been shown to be an intestinal antiinflammatory agent in rat and mouse experimental colitis. In rats, pretreatment with Pamidronate improves chemically induced trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid and dextran sulfate sodium colitis, and this beneficial effect is extended to lymphocyte transfer colitis. Pamidronate has no effect on intestinal epithelial cells in vitro in terms of cytokine/chemokine release, but enhances IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, and IL-10 production by T cells in coculture. Pamidronate also exerts a direct immunomodulatory effect on T cells, favoring Th1 differentiation and impairing Th17 polarization. In mice, Pamidronate has been shown to reduce colitis in the adoptive lymphocyte transfer model.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, experience with bilateral cochlear implants does not improve sound localization acuity in children.\n\nExplanation: The provided context does not mention any studies or research on children using bilateral cochlear implants and their sound localization abilities. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if experience with bilateral cochlear implants improves sound localization acuity in children based on the given information.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, gM-CSF does not contribute to prompt healing of ecthyma gangrenosum lesions in kidney transplant recipient.\n\nExplanation: The provided context discusses the role of gM-CSF in wound healing, specifically in diabetic and colitis wounds. However, it does not mention anything about ecthyma gangrenosum lesions in kidney transplant recipients. Therefore, based on the given context, it cannot be concluded that gM-CSF contributes to prompt healing of ecthyma gangrenosum lesions in kidney transplant recipient.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, pterygium is related to a decrease in corneal endothelial cell density. This was found in a retrospective cross-sectional study where 90 consecutive patients with unilateral primary pterygium were enrolled and corneal endothelial cell density was measured in both eyes. The relationship between the percentage of pterygium to cornea and a decrease in the ECD was analyzed and an increase in astigmatism in eyes with pterygium was evaluated for association with decreased ECD using the Pearson correlation test. The study found that lower corneal endothelial cell density values were found in older emmetropic, myopic, and hyperopic subjects, and a significant correlation between endothelial cell density and age was found in emmetropic, myopic, and hyperopic subjects.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, long-term reversal of hypocholesterolaemia in patients with chronic hepatitis C is related to sustained viral response and viral genotype. In patients with genotype-3 of HCV and sustained viral response, serum cholesterol increased from 138 (95% CI: 120-151) to 180 mg/dL (95% CI: 171-199) 12 months after treatment conclusion (P < 0.0001). By contrast, cholesterol values were unchanged in genotype-3 of HCV non-responders and in patients with genotype-1 of HCV regardless of response. Rising cholesterol in sustained viral response did not parallel the changes in beta-hydroxybutyrate.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The present study aimed to investigate if life style interventions/weight reduction could decrease cathepsin L and S levels in blood plasma. However, the study did not specifically focus on moderately overweight individuals. The study adjusted for several factors including age, body mass index, fasting plasma glucose, diabetes treatment, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, hypertension treatment, serum cholesterol, serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, prior cardiovascular disease, smoking, and leisure time physical activity. The study found that higher cathepsin S was associated with higher CRP and higher serum IL-6 after 7 yr. However, the study did not specifically focus on moderately overweight individuals.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, the provided context does not mention any association between a novel polymorphism of the CYP19 gene and essential hypertension in China. The context discusses the association of a polymorphism in the CYP11B2 gene with hypertension in the Chinese population, but does not mention any association with the CYP19 gene.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, simple and complex alternative splicing (ASE) patterns may be subject to opposite selection forces for protein reading frame preservation. Simple ASEs have higher frame preservation rates (FRFPs) than constitutively spliced exons (CSEs), while complex ASEs have lower FRFPs than CSEs. The selection pressure on frame preservation is likely relaxed in complex ASEs because they may alter the ends of their flanking exons. Conservation of the ASE/CSE splicing pattern increases the FRFPs of simple ASEs but decreases those of complex ASEs. Contrary to the well-recognized concept of strong selection pressure on conserved ASEs for protein reading frame preservation, our results show that conserved complex ASEs are relaxed from such pressure and the frame-disrupting effect caused by the insertion of complex ASEs can be offset by compensatory changes in their flanking exons.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, high nuclear expression of HDGF is associated with clinicopathological parameters such as T and clinical stage in human endometrial carcinoma. Furthermore, patients with increased HDGF expression levels have poorer overall survival rates than those with low expression of HDGF levels.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The provided context does not provide enough information to determine whether 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scanning is more useful in followup than in the initial assessment of patients with Erdheim-Chester disease. However, it does mention that the study group comprised 43 presymptomatic (preHD) subjects carrying the HD mutation who underwent a (18)F-FDG PET scan and were prospectively followed-up for at least 5 years using the unified HD rating scale to detect clinical changes. Multiple regression analysis included subject's age, CAG mutation size and glucose uptake as variables in a model to predict age at onset. Therefore, it can be inferred that the study aimed to assess the value of whole-body scanning with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in a large cohort of ECD patients from a single center, specifically in predicting age at onset.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) was significantly higher in tumor tissues of the human head and neck, skin, pancreatic, and prostate compared to adjacent normal tissues. However, UCP2 was lower in non-small cell lung tumor tissues, which is marginally significant.",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, air quality influences the prevalence of hay fever and sinusitis. The study found that higher concentrations of air quality criteria pollutants, such as carbon monoxide, nitrous dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter, were associated with a higher prevalence of hay fever and sinusitis. The study also found that the control condition of weak/failing kidneys had a very small relationship with air quality, while the relationship with hay fever and sinusitis was substantially larger.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, s 23521 decreases food intake and body weight gain in diet-induced obese rats. The treatment significantly reduced cumulative energy intake, body weight gain, adiposity, and plasma triglyceride levels in obese rats. Additionally, s 23521 improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in obese rats.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the study suggests that anti-NMDA receptor autoantibodies and associated neurobehavioral pathology in mice are dependent on age of first exposure to Toxoplasma gondii. The study found that juvenile-compared to adult-infected mice had significantly greater elevations of GLUN2 autoantibodies and age-dependent differences in regional expression of NMDAR subunits and markers of glutamatergic, GABAergic, and monoaminergic systems. Additionally, the study found that mice infected with T. gondii at postnatal day 33 (adolescent/juvenile) had decreased pre-pulse inhibition of the acoustic startle (PPI) in juveniles, while mice infected at postnatal day 61 (adult) had increased PPI in adults. These findings suggest that the age during first exposure to T. gondii may affect the development of neurobehavioral pathology and the immune response in mice.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, risedronate gastrointestinal absorption is dependent on site and rate of administration. In study A, risedronate solution was administered directly into the stomach, the second part of the duodenum, or the terminal ileum, and significant differences in absorption were observed between the three sites. In study B, risedronate solution was administered directly into the second part of the duodenum over 1 minute or over 1 hour, and significant differences in absorption were observed between the two rates of administration. Therefore, risedronate gastrointestinal absorption is dependent on both site and rate of administration.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) does not protect renal tubular epithelial cells in hypoxia-reperfusion by reducing apoptosis. The study aimed to elucidate the role of NGAL in regulating apoptosis of tubular epithelial cells in a hypoxia-reperfusion model, but the results did not support this hypothesis.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, high body mass index (BMI) was associated with increased diurnal strains in the articular cartilage of the knee. Subjects with high BMI exhibited significantly higher compressive strains in the tibial cartilage compared to those with normal BMI. Additionally, cartilage thickness on both femoral condyles decreased significantly from the AM to the PM time point; however, there was no significant effect of BMI on diurnal cartilage strain in the femur.",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the study suggests that soluble oncoprotein 185HER-2 in pleural fluid has limited usefulness for the diagnostic evaluation of malignant effusions. The study found that pleural sp185(HER-2) levels greater than 25 ng/mL were observed in only 20% of breast and 10% of lung adenocarcinomas, and predicted a malignant effusion with a sensitivity of 7% and a likelihood ratio of 7.6. Additionally, the study found that adding sp185(HER-2) to a panel of CEA and CA 15-3 did not significantly increase sensitivity for the diagnosis of malignant effusions.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, bevacizumab does not cause greater mitochondrial dysfunction than Temozolomide in human brain tumors. In fact, the study found that Temozolomide caused greater membrane depolarization and mitochondrial swelling in both grades of brain tumors.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study found no difference in diuresis, urine osmolality, or aquaporin-2 excretion between genders. However, there was a trend towards a higher reabsorption of free water in males. The excretion of prostaglandin E2 was higher in males. There was no diurnal rhythm in p-oxytocin and no correlation to diuresis, urine osmolality, or aquaporin-2 excretions.",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate supplementation affects Walker 256 tumor-bearing rats in a time-dependent manner. In the study, rats were supplemented with either beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate or saline for 4 weeks. After the experimental period, the animals were subjected to the glucose tolerance test (GTT) and plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) concentration measurements. The soleus skeletal muscle, liver, and white adipose tissue were removed for molecular (western blotting and RT-PCR) and histological analysis. The results showed that beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate supplementation significantly increased the levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate in the blood of the rats, and also increased the survival time of the rats. Additionally, the study found that the effects of beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate supplementation on metabolic parameters were time-dependent, with the greatest effects observed after 4 weeks of supplementation.",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the cAMP effectors Epac and PKA are involved in the hepatic cystogenesis of an animal model of ARPKD. The study found that both normal and PCK cholangiocytes increase their growth upon Epac-specific stimulation, while PKA-specific stimulation results in differential effects, suppressing proliferation in normal cholangiocytes but accelerating this process in PCK cholangiocytes. Additionally, both PKA and Epac activation of cystic structures generated by normal and PCK cholangiocytes when cultured under three-dimensional conditions resulted in increased cyst growth, particularly in PCK-cholangiocyte derived cysts.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, chronic administration of atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone and clozapine can improve behavioral and synaptic defects of STOP null mice. Risperidone has been shown to alleviate behavioral alterations mimicking some negative symptoms and partially ameliorate some cognitive defects in STOP null mice. Clozapine treatment also improves synaptic plasticity of the STOP null animals by restoring long-term potentiation in the hippocampus.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study aimed to determine whether the presence of Chlamydia pneumoniae correlates with plaque instability in patients with advanced carotid artery atherosclerosis. The study used molecular biological detection methods and clinically relevant indicators of pathology in carotid artery atheroma to study the association between C pneumoniae and plaque instability. The study found that the presence of C pneumoniae was associated with plaque instability in patients with advanced carotid artery atherosclerosis.",

      "Over expression of UCP2 in certain tumors provides the rationale to speculate that UCP2 may promote tumor growth in these cancers.",
      "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading known genetic cause of autism spectrum disorders. Individuals with FXS show symptoms of auditory hypersensitivity. These symptoms may arise due to sustained neural responses to repeated sounds, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. For the first time, this study shows deficits in habituation of neural responses to repeated sounds in the Fmr1 KO mice as seen in humans with FXS. We also report an abnormally high level of matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) in the auditory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice and that deletion of Mmp-9 from Fmr1 KO mice reverses habituation deficits. These data provide a translation relevant electrophysiological biomarker for sensory deficits in FXS and implicate MMP-9 as a target for drug discovery.",
      "Prevalence of hay fever and sinusitis are correlated with air quality. Improvements in air quality are associated with decreased prevalence of both hay fever and sinusitis. Laryngoscope, 2009.",
      "S 23521 is an effective glucagon-like peptide-1-(7-36) amide analogue, which induced a decrease in energy intake, body weight, and adiposity in a rat model of diet-induced obesity. In addition, the treatment also improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity of obese rats. These results strongly support S 23521 as a putative molecule for the treatment of obesity.",
      "Our study demonstrates that the age at first exposure to T. gondii is an important factor in shaping distinct behavioral and neurobiological abnormalities. Elevation in GLUN2 autoantibodies or complement protein C1q may be a potential underlying mechanism. A better understanding of these age-related differences may lead to more efficient treatments of behavioral disorders associated with T. gondii infection.",
      "These studies indicate that the rate and extent of risedronate absorption are independent of the site of administration along the gastrointestinal tract, and that the extent of absorption is not affected by the rate of administration.",
      "These findings indicate that NGAL reduces apoptosis by regulating the four apoptosis factors Bcl-2, Bax, Fas and FasL through its two receptors 24p3R and megalin. These results also suggest that ectopic expression of NGAL in renal cells might provide a therapeutic strategy in ischemia-reperfusion by reducing apoptosis and promoting renal cell proliferation.",
      "Increased BMI is associated with increased diurnal strains in articular cartilage of both the medial and lateral compartments of the knee. The increased cartilage strains observed in individuals with high BMI may, in part, explain the elevated risk of OA associated with obesity or may reflect alterations in the cartilage mechanical properties in subjects with high BMI.",
      "The data demonstrate that EA activates the adrenals to increase plasma corticosterone levels and suppress edema and suggest that EA effects differ in healthy subjects and in those with pathologies.",
      "Measurement of pleural fluid sp185(HER-2) has poor diagnostic performance in patients with malignant effusions.",
      "TMZ and BEV can directly cause the dysfunction of mitochondria isolated from human brain tumors. However, BEV has a greater ability to disturb mitochondrial function in mitochondria isolated from human brain tumors than either TMZ or calcium overload conditions.",
      "Similar urinary flows and osmolalities are associated with levels of plasma vasopressin and renal PGE2, which are higher in males than in females. Oxytocin does not seem to play a role in the diurnal urine formation, whereas prostaglandin E2 could represent a mediator of the gender difference, not only as a mediator of the vasopressin response, but also as an independent factor. These findings need further elucidation.",
      "MICR has a very transient impact on plasma levels of endostatin and no impact on angiostatin during the first 21 days following surgery. Thus, angiostatin and endostatin do not likely contribute to or inhibit the persistent proangiogenic changes noted after MICR.",
      "Dietary guidelines for CVD risk reduction may also benefit bone health in this Hispanic cohort. Synchronizing dietary guidelines for these 2 common diseases may provide a simplified public health message. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01231958.",
      "Basophils may worsen Th2 inflammatory disorders through direct interactions with pathogenic CD4 T cells as well as by enhancing DC-induced Th2 cell development.",
      "We conclude that inhibition of TLR4 with eritoran in an in situ murine model significantly reduces MI/R injury and markers of an inflammatory response.",
      "HMbeta supplementation can increase survival time and promotes metabolic changes in cancer-bearing animals, but it seems to work in a time-dependent manner.",
      "The probability of a successful cardioversion correlates inversely with NT-proBNP values. The short-term success of a cardioversion might be predicted by prior determination of NT-proBNP.",
      "These data provide evidence that there are no obvious adverse effects of acute or more chronic Cr supplementation on the haematological indices measured, nor on hepatic, muscle, and renal function. Therefore there is no apparent health risk associated with Cr supplementation to healthy people when it is ingested in quantities that have been scientifically proven to increase muscle Cr stores.",
      "Our data provide strong evidence that both cAMP effectors, Epac and PKA, and the levels of intracellular calcium are involved in the hepatic cystogenesis of ARPKD.",
      "All together, the pharmacological reactivity of STOP null mice to antipsychotics evokes the pharmacological response of humans to such drugs. Totally, our study suggests that STOP null mice may provide a useful preclinical model to evaluate pharmacological properties of antipsychotic drugs.",
      "This study confirms that C pneumoniae is a common finding in atherosclerotic plaques of the carotid artery but suggests that the presence of the infectious organism has little detectable impact on plaque instability when measured by clinically significant markers. This raises important questions for the rationale of antibiotic therapy in atherosclerosis.",
      "Moxibustion exerted its effect on healing impaired colonic mucosa in rats with TNBS-induced colitis by increasing the degranulation ratio of local MC, but had little effect on the morphology of MC at ST25 acupoint.",
      "Laser Doppler flowmetry detected circulatory abnormalities in primary open-angle glaucoma suspects who did not have any manifest visual field defect. Decreases in flow in glaucoma suspects were similar in magnitude to those of subjects with primary open-angle glaucoma. These data suggest that impaired optic nerve blood flow develops early in the glaucomatous process and does not develop solely as a result of glaucoma damage."
