    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, obvious emphysema on computed tomography during an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease predicts a poor prognosis.\n\nExplanation: The study aimed to study the relationship between prognosis and emphysematous changes on CT during an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The study found that emphysematous change was quantified by measuring the percentage of low-attenuation areas (LAA%) in the entire lung on CT images with a threshold of -950 Hounsfield units. Other factors that could influence AECOPD prognosis were also recorded on admission and analysed. At follow ups conducted in 1 year, patient survival, the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnoea Scale, and performance status (PS) were evaluated, and a COPD Assessment Test (CAT) was completed. The study found that patients with obvious emphysema on CT during an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease had a poor prognosis.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, chemokine expression patterns in the systemic and genital tract compartments are associated with HIV-1 infection in women from Benin.\n\nExplanation: The study compared levels of both genital mucosal and blood chemokines between HIV-1-uninfected and HIV-1-infected female commercial sex workers (CSWs) as well as HIV-1-uninfected non-CSW control women at low risk for exposure, recruited in Cotonou, Benin. The study found that levels of chemokines in the systemic and genital tract compartments were significantly different between HIV-1-infected and HIV-1-uninfected women. Specifically, the study found that levels of chemokines in the genital tract compartment were significantly higher in HIV-1-infected women compared to HIV-1-uninfected women. Additionally, the study found that levels of chemokines in the systemic compartment were significantly higher in HIV-1-infected women compared to HIV-1-uninfected women. These findings suggest that chemokine expression patterns in the systemic and genital tract compartments are associated with HIV-1 infection in women from Benin.",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, clove and eugenol in noncytotoxic concentrations exert immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory action on cytokine production by murine macrophages. Clove (100\u00b5g/well) inhibited IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-10 production and exerted an efficient action either before or after LPS challenge for all cytokines. Eugenol did not affect IL-1\u03b2 production but inhibited IL-6 and IL-10 production. The action of eugenol (50 or 100\u00b5g/well) on IL-6 production prevented efficiently effects of LPS either before or after its addition, whereas on IL-10 production it counteracted significantly LPS action when added after LPS incubation.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, pretreatment with stellate ganglion blockade before ischemia does not reduce infarct size in rat hearts.\n\nExplanation: The provided context discusses the role of stellate ganglion blockade (SGB) in cardio-protection against ischemia reperfusion injury, but it does not mention anything about pretreatment with SGB before ischemia reducing infarct size in rat hearts. The study carried out between August and October 2008 in the Department of Anesthesia, Abant Izzet Baysal University, Bolu, Turkey, investigated the effect of SGB on neural remodelling after myocardial infarction (MI) and found that SGB did not reduce infarct size. Therefore, the answer is no, pretreatment with SGB before ischemia does not reduce infarct size in rat hearts.",

    "\n\nAnswer: No, hemoglobin levels do not predict biochemical outcome for localized prostate cancer treated with neoadjuvant androgen-suppression therapy and external-beam radiotherapy.\n\nExplanation: The provided context indicates that hemoglobin levels are not taken into account in internal radiotherapy and that there is no strong association between hemoglobin levels and tumor control in head and neck cancer treated with radiotherapy. Additionally, the provided context does not mention any studies or research that has investigated the relationship between hemoglobin levels and biochemical outcome for localized prostate cancer treated with neoadjuvant androgen-suppression therapy and external-beam radiotherapy. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude that hemoglobin levels predict biochemical outcome for this specific treatment regimen.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, non-esterified fatty acids can impair insulin-mediated glucose uptake and disposition in the liver. This is supported by the findings that the amount of visceral fat was not associated with the degree of fatty liver, but whole-body glucose disposal was inversely associated with fatty liver. Additionally, the insulin sensitivity index for NEFA was decreased in individuals with severe fatty liver. Furthermore, the study by [Document(page_content='Whether excess glucose (glucotoxicity) and excess non-esterified fatty acids (lipotoxicity) act synergistically or separately to alter beta-cell function on Type 2 diabetes remains controversial.

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, induction of oral tolerance to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) attenuates the initiation and progression of atherogenesis in LDL receptor-/- mice fed a Western-type diet. This is achieved through an increase in CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ cells in spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes, which specifically respond to oxLDL with increased transforming growth factor-beta production. Additionally, tolerance to oxLDL increases the mRNA expression of Foxp3, CTLA-4, and CD25 in the plaque. In contrast, tolerance to malondialdehyde-treated LDL (MDA-LDL) does not affect atherogenesis.",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the present study tested the hypothesis that rosuvastatin treatment may attenuate left ventricular (LV) remodelling and dysfunction in the failing heart, which may be associated with alterations of Ca(2+)-regulatory protein. The study investigated the change of LV remodelling and function in a rat model of cardiac dysfunction due to myocardial infarction (MI) with or without rosuvastatin (10 mg/kg/day) treatment for 10 weeks. The protein expression of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA)2a, phospholamban (PLB), and phospho-PLB at serine-16 (pSer16-PLB), as well as SERCA activity, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-10 levels were evaluated. After rosuvastatin treatment, LV remodelling and dysfunction were prevented. Rosuvastatin prevented the decrease of SERCA2a and pSer16-PLB expression, increased SERCA activity, but showed no effect on PLB expression. Furthermore, rosuvastatin reduced the increased IL-6 level and further elevated IL-10 level in the peri-infarct and remote zones of MI. Serum lipid levels remained",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, prolonged resuscitation of metabolic acidosis after trauma is associated with more complications. In the study, morbidly obese patients with persistent metabolic acidosis developed MOF at a significantly greater rate than did normal weight patients with or without persistent metabolic acidosis. Additionally, in the study, the duration of metabolic crisis was longer in those patients with unfavorable (GOSe \u2264 6) versus favorable (GOSe \u2265 7) outcome at 6 months.

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, leukocytosis is proportional to HELLP syndrome severity. This is evident from the regression analysis which showed that platelet counts varied inversely with WBC counts. Patients with class I HELLP syndrome had significantly higher WBC counts than patients with other classes of HELLP syndrome. Additionally, circulating TSP-1 levels were significantly lower in HELLP syndrome compared to all other study groups, while they were unaltered in preeclampsia compared to the control groups. There was a significant positive linear correlation between TSP-1 levels and platelet count in HELLP syndrome. These findings suggest that HELLP syndrome is an inflammatory form of preeclampsia.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the study found that high DcR3 expression was associated with high-grade and high-stage RCCs, increased incidence of distant metastasis and lymph node metastasis, and poorer disease-specific and progression-free survival in univariate analyses. Additionally, DcR3 expression was an independent prognostic factor that outperformed the Karnofsky performance status in multivariate Cox regression analysis. In patients with high-stage RCCs expressing DcR3, the 2-year survival probability was 25%, whereas in patients with DcR3-negative tumors, the survival probability was 65% (P <.001).",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, a Multi-Component Prime-Boost Vaccination Regimen with a Consensus MOMP Antigen enhances Chlamydia trachomatis Clearance. The DNA-HuAd5-MVA-Protein vaccine regimen induced a cellular response with a Th1-biased serum antibody response, alongside high serum and vaginal MOMP-specific antibodies. This regimen significantly enhanced clearance against intravaginal C. trachomatis serovar D infection in both BALB/c and B6C3F1 mouse strains. This enhanced clearance was shown to be CD4(+) T-cell dependent.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the angiotensin II type 2 receptor agonist Compound 21 has been shown to be protective in an experimental model of diabetes-associated atherosclerosis. This study is the first to investigate the role of the novel selective AT2R agonist, Compound 21 (C21) in an experimental model of diabetes-associated atherosclerosis (DAA). The results suggest that C21 may contribute to possible insulin-sensitizing/anti-diabetic effects in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) with PPAR\u03b3 activation, mainly focusing on adipose tissue.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, fitness and adiposity are independently associated with cardiometabolic risk in youth.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe context provides information about the independent associations of muscle fitness and cardiorespiratory fitness with clustered metabolic risk in youth. However, it does not directly address the association between fitness and adiposity with cardiometabolic risk in youth.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider the background context, which mentions the association between cardiometabolic risk markers and socio-economic differences in children. We can assume that fitness and adiposity are both cardiometabolic risk markers that are associated with socio-economic differences.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that fitness and adiposity are independently associated with cardiometabolic risk in youth, as both are cardiometabolic risk markers that are associated with socio-economic differences.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, patient-prosthesis mismatch in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement can affect survival. An independent detrimental effect of prosthesis-patient mismatch on survival was observed in patients with aortic stenosis/mixed disease who had preoperative left ventricular dysfunction (hazard ratio, 2.3; P =.03). However, no such effect was observed in patients with aortic insufficiency, irrespective of left ventricular function.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, lifetime sport and leisure activity participation is associated with greater bone size, quality and strength in older men. The study found that a high frequency of competitive sports early in life is associated with bone mineral density (BMD) at several bone sites, indicating that increases in BMD following PA are preserved longer than previously believed. Additionally, the study used dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to assess hip, spine and ultradistal (UD) radius areal bone mineral density (aBMD), quantitative ultrasound (QUS) to measure heel bone quality, and quantitative computed tomography (QCT) to assess volumetric BMD, bone geometry and strength at the spine and mid-femur. The results showed that current (>50+ years) and past hours of sport and leisure activity participation during adolescence (13-18 years) and adulthood (19-50 years) were associated with greater bone size, quality and strength in older men.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, hemizygous deletion of CTGF/CCN2 does not suffice to prevent fibrosis of the severely injured kidney.\n\nExplanation: The study examined the effects of CCN2 haploinsufficiency on the progression of renal scarring in long-term STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy, in a more advanced stage of obstructive nephropathy following unilateral ureteric obstruction (UUO), and in severe aristolochic acid (AA)-induced tubulotoxic nephritis. The results showed that hemizygous deletion of CCN2 did not prevent fibrosis of the severely injured kidney. Therefore, it can be concluded that hemizygous deletion of CTGF/CCN2 does not suffice to prevent fibrosis of the severely injured kidney.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, severity of hepatic encephalopathy before liver transplantation is associated with quality of life after transplantation. The study found that patients with more severe hepatic encephalopathy before transplantation had lower quality of life after transplantation compared to those with less severe hepatic encephalopathy before transplantation.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, sutureless securement device StatLock has been shown to reduce catheter-related complications when compared to tape in earlier studies. In this study, 170 patients requiring PICCs were randomized to suture or StatLock securement and followed throughout their entire catheter course. PICC-related complications including dislodgment, infection, occlusion, leakage, and central venous thrombosis were documented and compared between the suture and StatLock groups. The results showed that the StatLock group had significantly fewer catheter-related complications compared to the suture group.\n\nIn addition, sutureless securement device has also been shown to have better hemodynamics at the venous outflow and potentially improve graft patency in new self-sealing prosthetic grafts. Endoluminal sutureless anastomosis has been demonstrated to have better hemodynamics at the venous outflow with a supposed reduction of venous neointimal hyperplasia (VNH), which is responsible for outflow stenosis and access thrombosis.",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, functional health literacy is associated with health status and health-related knowledge in people living with HIV-AIDS. This is supported by the findings of a study that recruited a community sample of 339 HIV-infected men and women and assessed their functional health literacy, health status, AIDS-related disease and treatment knowledge, and health care perceptions and experiences. The study found that patients with inadequate health literacy had lower CD4 cell counts, higher viral loads, were less likely to be taking antiretroviral medications, reported a greater number of hospitalizations, and reported poorer health than those with marginal or adequate health literacy. In addition, after adjusting for years of formal education, lower health literacy was associated with poorer knowledge of one's HIV-related health status, poorer AIDS-related disease and treatment knowledge, and more negative health care perceptions and experiences.",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, soy protein isolates of varied isoflavone content can influence serum thyroid hormones in healthy young men. The study found that high-isoflavone soy protein isolate (61.7 +/- 7.4 mg iso/day) significantly decreased total triiodothyronine (T3) and free T3 levels, while low-isoflavone soy protein isolate (1.64 +/- 0.19 mg iso/day) had no significant effect on these levels. Milk protein isolate (MPI) had no significant effect on these levels. Additionally, the study found that high-isoflavone soy protein isolate (61.7 +/- 7.4 mg iso/day) significantly decreased total thyroxine (T4) levels, while low-isoflavone soy protein isolate (1.64 +/- 0.19 mg iso/day) had no significant effect on these levels. Milk protein isolate (MPI) had no significant effect on these levels. The study also found that high-isoflavone soy protein isolate (61.7 +/- 7.4 mg iso/day) significantly decreased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, while low-isoflav",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, immunity to blood stages of Plasmodium falciparum is dependent on a specific pattern of immunoglobulin subclass responses to multiple blood stage antigens. This is supported by previous studies showing that IgG1 and IgG3 responses against antigens like ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigens, merozoite surface proteins and variant surface antigens on schizonts were associated with clinical immunity against malaria. None of the specific responses against a single antigen was completely protective.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, recombination pattern reanalysis of some HIV-1 circulating recombination forms suggests the necessity and difficulty of revision. The current study was based on multiple recombination analysis, which may have produced more impartial results. The analysis of a representative set of HIV-1 subtype B pol sequences from 5700 patients enrolled in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study suggests that recombination pattern reanalysis of some HIV-1 circulating recombination forms may be necessary and difficult. The analysis based on the predicted networks suggests that significantly stronger recombination signals were observed for the inferred ancestors of the X4 strains, recombination events between different lineages and recombination events between putative reservoir virus and those from a later population, an early star-like topology observed for four of the patients who died of AIDS, and a significantly higher number of recombinants were predicted at sampling points that corresponded to peaks in the viral load levels. These findings suggest that recombination pattern reanalysis of some HIV-1 circulating recombination forms may be necessary and difficult, and may require more advanced recombination detection techniques and analysis methods.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, osteopontin has been identified as the most highly upregulated factor early after neonatal cerebral hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Therefore, it is likely that osteopontin plays a role in endogenous repair after neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. However, further research is needed to determine the specific mechanisms by which osteopontin enhances repair after neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury.",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, p130 plays a role in TGF-beta-induced cell-cycle arrest in Rb mutant HT-3 cells. TGF-beta markedly enhanced the binding of p21 with cdk2 but decreased that of cdk2 with cyclin E and inhibited the phosphorylation of p130. Additionally, E2F-4 protein level was lower in TGF-beta-treated cells, which might be the result of enhanced binding between E2F-4 and p130.",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, dNA-PKcs expression was found to be a predictor of biochemical recurrence after permanent Iodine 125 interstitial brachytherapy for prostate cancer. In the study, positive dNA-PKcs nuclear staining was closely associated with biochemical recurrence (P=.003). On multivariate analysis, only dNA-PKcs and clinical stage remained predictive of recurrence.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, chemotherapy for cancer causes apoptosis that precedes hypoplasia in crypts of the small intestine in humans.\n\nExplanation: The context provides information about the effects of chemotherapy on the small intestine in humans. According to the first document, chemotherapy increased apoptosis in intestinal crypts at one day, and villus area, crypt length, mitotic count per crypt, and enterocyte height decreased at three days after chemotherapy. This suggests that chemotherapy causes apoptosis in the small intestine, which precedes hypoplasia in crypts. The second document also supports this conclusion by stating that chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in the small intestine is associated with a significant increase in crypt proliferation combined with an inhibition of apoptosis. Therefore, chemotherapy for cancer causes apoptosis that precedes hypoplasia in crypts of the small intestine in humans.",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, combination therapy with VELCADE and tissue plasminogen activator is neuroprotective in aged rats after stroke and targets microRNA-146a and the toll-like receptor signaling pathway. The study found that combination treatment with VELCADE and tPA reduced infarct volume compared with respective monotherapies. The study also found that the combination treatment increased miR-l46a levels, which was inversely associated with the reduction of vascular interleukin-1 receptor-activated kinases 1 immunoreactivity. In vitro, fibrin upregulated interleukin-1 receptor-activated kinases 1 and TLR4 expression and downregulated miR-146a on primary human cerebral endothelial cells. VELCADE elevated miR-146 levels and abolished fibrin-increased interleukin-1 receptor activated kinases 1 proteins. The study also found that combination therapy with VELCADE and tPA reduced deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL), cleaved caspase-3, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, higher peak weight velocity (PWV) in infancy was associated with a significant increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in children at 10 years. For each 10.2\\u200acm/year [2 standard deviation (SD)] increase in PWV, SBP increased by 2.94 mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.34, 4.54] after adjustment for potential confounders including birth weight and body mass index. A 5.1\\u200akg/year (2 SD) higher PWV was associated with a 2.13 mmHg (95% CI 0.51, 3.74) increase in SBP and a 1.91 mmHg (95% CI 0.52, 3.30) increase in DBP. No consistent associations were found between PWV and the Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) index after multiple adjustments.",

    "\n\nAnswer: No, postoperative CMF does not ameliorate poor outcomes in women with residual invasive breast cancer after neoadjuvant epirubicin/docetaxel chemotherapy.\n\nExplanation: The study included 191 women with breast cancer who received preoperative chemotherapy with epirubicin/docetaxel. The study population was divided into two groups: those with residual invasive breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n=161) and those with residual invasive breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and postoperative CMF (n=30). The study found that postoperative CMF did not improve the overall survival or event-free survival of women with residual invasive breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Therefore, postoperative CMF does not ameliorate poor outcomes in women with residual invasive breast cancer after neoadjuvant epirubicin/docetaxel chemotherapy.",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the bisphosphonate Pamidronate has been shown to be an intestinal antiinflammatory agent in rat and mouse experimental colitis. In the trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid model of colitis in rats, treatment with Pamidronate improved the severity of colitis and reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines in the intestinal tissue. Additionally, Pamidronate has been shown to enhance the production of IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, and IL-10 by T cells in vitro, which may contribute to its antiinflammatory effects. In the adoptive lymphocyte transfer model of colitis in mice, Pamidronate also improved the severity of colitis and reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines in the intestinal tissue. Overall, these findings suggest that Pamidronate may be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of colitis in humans.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, experience with bilateral cochlear implants does not improve sound localization acuity in children.\n\nExplanation: The study aimed to characterize horizontal plane sound localization in interfering noise at different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and to compare performance across normal-hearing listeners and users of unilateral and bilateral cochlear implants (CIs). The study found that children who underwent sequential bilateral cochlear implantation had similar sound localization acuity to normal-hearing listeners and users of unilateral CIs. Therefore, experience with bilateral cochlear implants does not improve sound localization acuity in children.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, GM-CSF does not contribute to prompt healing of ecthyma gangrenosum lesions in kidney transplant recipient.\n\nExplanation: The provided context discusses the role of GM-CSF in wound healing, specifically in diabetic and colitis models. However, it does not mention anything about ecthyma gangrenosum lesions in kidney transplant recipients. Therefore, based on the given context, it cannot be concluded that GM-CSF contributes to prompt healing of ecthyma gangrenosum lesions in kidney transplant recipients.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, pterygium is related to a decrease in corneal endothelial cell density. The study found that there was a significant decrease in corneal endothelial cell density in patients with unilateral primary pterygium compared to age-matched control groups. Additionally, an increase in astigmatism in eyes with pterygium was evaluated for association with decreased ECD using the Pearson correlation test.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, long-term reversal of hypocholesterolaemia in patients with chronic hepatitis C is related to sustained viral response and viral genotype. The study found that in patients with genotype-3 of HCV and sustained viral response, serum cholesterol increased from 138 (95% CI: 120-151) to 180 mg/dL (95% CI: 171-199) 12 months after treatment conclusion (P < 0.0001). By contrast, cholesterol values were unchanged in genotype-3 of HCV non-responders and in patients with genotype-1 of HCV regardless of response. The study also found that elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels and statin use have been associated with higher sustained virological response (SVR) rates in patients receiving chronic hepatitis C therapy. However, the relationship between high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and virological response is not well characterized in randomized controlled trials.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The present study aimed to investigate the association between life style interventions/weight reduction and decreased levels of cathepsins L and S in plasma. The study included a community-based sample of individuals with normal body mass index (BMI) and found that higher cathepsin S was associated with higher CRP and IL-6 after 7 years. However, the study did not specifically investigate the association between life style interventions and decreased levels of cathepsins L and S in moderately overweight individuals. Therefore, the answer to the question is not clear based on the provided context.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, a novel polymorphism of the CYP19 gene was not found to be associated with essential hypertension in China.\n\nExplanation: The provided context discusses two studies that investigated the association of polymorphisms in the CYP11B2 and CYP4A11 genes with hypertension in the Chinese population. However, it does not mention any study on the association of polymorphisms in the CYP19 gene with hypertension in China. Therefore, it is not possible to answer the question based on the provided context.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, simple and complex alternative splicing exons (ASEs) may be subject to opposite selection forces for protein reading frame preservation. Simple ASEs have higher frequency of reading frame preservation (FRFP) than constitutively spliced exons (CSEs), while complex ASEs have lower FRFP than CSEs. Conservation of the ASE/CSE splicing pattern increases the FRFPs of simple ASEs but decreases those of complex ASEs. Furthermore, complex ASEs may alter the ends of their flanking exons, leading to relaxed selection pressure on frame preservation.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, high nuclear expression of HDGF correlates with disease progression and poor prognosis in human endometrial carcinoma. The study found that patients with increased HDGF expression levels had poorer overall survival rates than those with low expression of HDGF levels (P=0.006). Additionally, high expression of nuclear HDGF was an independent prognostic indicator of patient survival.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The provided context does not provide enough information to determine whether 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scanning is more useful in followup than in the initial assessment of patients with Erdheim-Chester disease. The context discusses the use of FDG-PET scanning in the initial assessment of patients with Erdheim-Chester disease and in the followup of patients with Huntington's disease, but it does not provide any information on the relative usefulness of FDG-PET scanning in these two contexts.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the protein levels of UCP2 were significantly higher in tumor tissues than that in the adjacent normal tissues in the human head and neck, skin, prostate, and pancreatic tumor samples examined.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, matrix metalloproteinase-9 deletion reverses auditory evoked potential habituation deficit in a mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, air quality influences the prevalence of hay fever and sinusitis. The study found that higher concentrations of air quality criteria pollutants, such as carbon monoxide, nitrous dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter, were associated with a higher prevalence of hay fever and sinusitis. The study also found that the control condition of weak/failing kidneys had a very small standardized regression coefficient with air quality, indicating that air quality had little influence on this condition.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, S 23521 decreased food intake and body weight gain in diet-induced obese rats. The subcutaneous treatment at high dose significantly reduced cumulative energy intake, body weight gain, adiposity, and plasma triglyceride levels. Additionally, the treatment improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity of obese rats. However, no changes in gene expression of several proteins involved in energy homeostasis were observed.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, anti-NMDA receptor autoantibodies and associated neurobehavioral pathology in mice are dependent on age of first exposure to Toxoplasma gondii. Juvenile and adult infected mice exhibited opposite effects of MK-801 on PPI, with decreased PPI in juveniles and increased PPI in adults. There was a significantly greater elevation of GLUN2 autoantibodies in juvenile-compared to adult-infected mice. In addition, age-dependent differences were found in regional expression of NMDAR subunits and markers of glutamatergic, GABAergic, and monoaminergic systems. Activated microglia and C1q elevations were found in both juvenile- and adult-T. gondii infected mice.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, risedronate gastrointestinal absorption is dependent on the site and rate of administration. In study A, no statistically significant site-specific differences in any pharmacokinetic parameter were observed, indicating that the absorption of risedronate is dependent on the site of administration. In study B, the extent of risedronate absorption did not differ significantly following a rapid or a slow infusion, indicating that the rate of administration also affects the absorption of risedronate.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The study aims to elucidate the role of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) in regulating apoptosis of tubular epithelial cells in a hypoxia-reperfusion model. However, the study does not provide evidence to support the claim that NGAL protects renal tubular epithelial cells in hypoxia-reperfusion by reducing apoptosis. The study only mentions that NGAL is involved in regulating apoptosis, but it does not provide any specific details on how NGAL protects renal tubular epithelial cells.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, high body mass index (BMI) is associated with increased diurnal strains in the articular cartilage of the knee. Subjects with high BMI had significantly thicker cartilage on both the patella and femoral groove, as compared to subjects with normal BMI. Diurnal cartilage strains were dependent on location in the knee joint, as well as BMI. Subjects with high BMI, compared to those with normal BMI, exhibited significantly higher compressive strains in the tibial cartilage. Cartilage thickness on both femoral condyles decreased significantly from the AM to the PM time point; however, there was no significant effect of BMI on diurnal cartilage strain in the femur.",
    "\n\nAnswer: The present study investigated the biochemical mechanisms of electroacupuncture (EA) anti-inflammation in a rat model. Three experiments were conducted to determine if EA regulates corticosterone secretion, the effects of the adrenal gland on the therapeutic actions of EA, and whether a prototypical glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, RU486, affects EA anti-edema. The results of the study suggest that corticosterone may mediate EA-produced anti-edema in a rat model of inflammation.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, soluble oncoprotein 185HER-2 in pleural fluid has limited usefulness for the diagnostic evaluation of malignant effusions. The sensitivity of sp185(HER-2) alone is only 7%, and the combination of sp185(HER-2) with CEA and CA 15-3 only increases sensitivity by 5%. Additionally, only 1 patient with breast adenocarcinoma among 45 cytology-negative malignant effusions had sp185(HER-2) above the diagnostic cutoff point. Therefore, sp185(HER-2) should not be relied upon as the sole diagnostic marker for malignant effusions.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, bevacizumab and Temozolomide have different mechanisms of action and do not necessarily cause mitochondrial dysfunction in human brain tumors. The study only investigated the direct effects of these drugs on mitochondria isolated from human brain tumors, and the results are not conclusive.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, urinary concentration does not exclusively rely on plasma vasopressin. The study found no difference in urine osmolality or aquaporin-2 excretion between genders. However, there was a trend towards a higher reabsorption of free water in males, which could be related to differences in plasma vasopressin levels. The study also found a diurnal rhythm in plasma vasopressin with a night-time increase in both genders, but no correlation to urinary concentration or excretion of aquaporin-2.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, plasma levels of angiostatin and endostatin are elevated for 2-4 weeks after colorectal cancer surgery.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, adherence to the 2006 American Heart Association Diet and Lifestyle Recommendations for cardiovascular disease risk reduction is not associated with bone health in older Puerto Ricans. In a cross-sectional study of 933 Puerto Ricans aged 47-79 y, bone mineral density (BMD) at the femoral neck, trochanter, total hip, and lumbar spine (L2-L4) was measured by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The study tested the hypothesis that adherence to the AHA-DLR is associated with bone health. However, the results showed no significant association between adherence to the AHA-DLR and bone health in older Puerto Ricans.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, basophils are recruited to inflamed lungs and exacerbate memory Th2 responses in mice and humans.\n\nExplanation: The study found that basophils accumulated in the lungs of OVA-immunized mice and that adoptive transfer of basophils to OVA-sensitized hosts enhanced lung IL-4 and IL-13 release. In vitro studies revealed that pulmonary basophils interacted with lung CD4 effectors to increase T cell survival and Th2 cytokine expression at the single cell level but amplified OVA-loaded DC-driven Th2 differentiation. Additionally, human basophils augmented in vitro IL-4 expression in effector memory CD4 T cells that include CRTH2(+) cells through IL-4 and TCR-independent pathways. These findings suggest that basophils play a role in exacerbating memory Th2 responses in mice and humans.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, inhibition of Toll-like receptor 4 with eritoran attenuates myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate supplementation does not affect Walker 256 tumor-bearing rats in a time-dependent manner.\n\nExplanation: The provided context does not mention any time-dependent effects of beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate supplementation on Walker 256 tumor-bearing rats. The only information provided is that rats supplemented with beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate had elevated levels of \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate and an increased median survival of approximately 5 days relative to animals maintained on standard diet. However, there is no information about how long these effects lasted or if they changed over time. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate supplementation affects Walker 256 tumor-bearing rats in a time-dependent manner.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No, nT-ProBNP does not predict rhythm stability after cardioversion of lone atrial fibrillation.",
    "\n\nAnswer: No indication of impairment to the haematological indices measured, hepatic function, or muscle damage was apparent after Cr supplementation. In contrast to previous reports, no detrimental effects of creatine supplementation on the renal function indices were observed in two-thirds nephrectomized or sham-operated animals. No differences were observed in inulin (0.28+/-0.08 vs 0.25+/-0.08 ml/min/100 g; P=NS) or creatinine clearance rates. Serum cystatin C concentration, urinary protein excretion, and albumin and urea clearance were comparable between creatine-supplemented and control-diet fed animals in both sham-operated and two-thirds nephrectomized animals. Serum creatine and intramuscular total creatine concentrations were higher in creatine-supplemented groups (P<0.05).",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the cAMP effectors Epac and PKA are involved in the hepatic cystogenesis of an animal model of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease ( ARPKD ). The study found that both normal and PCK cholangiocytes increase their growth upon Epac-specific stimulation, while PKA-specific stimulation results in differential effects, suppressing proliferation in normal cholangiocytes but accelerating this process in PCK cholangiocytes. Additionally, both PKA and Epac activation of cystic structures generated by normal and PCK cholangiocytes when cultured under three-dimensional conditions resulted in increased cyst growth, particularly in PCK-cholangiocyte derived cysts. The study also demonstrated the specificity of each effector activation and the involvement of MEK-ERK1/2 signaling in all the observed effector-associated proliferation changes.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, chronic administration of atypical antipsychotics, specifically risperidone and clozapine, improves behavioral and synaptic defects of STOP null mice. Long-term administration of either drug results in alleviation of behavioral alterations mimicking some negative symptoms and partial amelioration of some cognitive defects in STOP null mice. Additionally, clozapine treatment also improves synaptic plasticity of the STOP null animals by restoring long-term potentiation in the hippocampus.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, Chlamydia pneumoniae has been associated with atherosclerotic disease and has been found to influence atherosclerotic plaque behavior in patients with established carotid artery stenosis. Studies have shown that the presence of C pneumoniae correlates with plaque instability and that C pneumoniae-induced transformation of a stable into an unstable atherosclerotic plaque or stimulation of hypercoagulability leading to increased thrombotic arterial occlusions may play a role in this disease. Additionally, research has shown that C pneumoniae infection may accelerate or even induce atherosclerosis in atherosclerosis-prone apolipoprotein E-knockout (apoE-KO) and wild-type C57BL/6J mice.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, moxibustion activates mast cell degranulation at the ST25 in rats with colitis.",
    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, optic nerve blood flow is diminished in eyes of primary open-angle glaucoma suspects.

      "Circulating AFABP, produced by adipocytes and macrophages, and lipocalin-2, produced by multiple tissues, are elevated and may contribute to the metabolic syndrome in NAFLD. AFABP levels, which correlate with subcutaneous, but not visceral fat, independently predict inflammation and fibrosis in NAFLD and may have a direct pathogenic link to disease progression.",
      "Increased timing variability in people with AD occurs during gait initiation as well as during constant speed walking and is evident in the early disease stages.",
      "The relatively few differences observed imply that pitching biomechanics remained remarkably similar between collegiate starting pitchers who threw between 105 and 135 pitches for 7 to 9 innings and approached muscular fatigue.",
      "Pamidronate presents antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory properties in 3 different models of experimental colitis in rodents. This effect requires oral administration and may involve T cells in the gut mucosa, although the exact mechanism is unclear.",
      "Spatial hearing skills in sequentially implanted children develop in an experience-dependent manner, perhaps because of the ability of the auditory system to use newly acquired electrical stimulation presented to the 2 ears.",
      "We suggest that the combination of GM-CSF with appropriate antibiotics can resolve EG and avoid or minimize the risk of septicemia in immunosuppressed patients.",
      "Pterygium is related to a decrease in corneal ECD. Surgical intervention should be considered in patients with extensive pterygium involvement in the cornea or a significant increase in astigmatism.",
      "Besides causing hepatic steatosis, genotype-3 specifically decreases serum cholesterol. This interference with the metabolic lipid pathway is related to viral load, is reversed with sustained viral response, and seems unrelated to mitochondrial dysfunction.",
      "The intervention program resulted in significant reductions of cathepsin L and S levels in plasma after 4 and 8 weeks of intervention.",
      "The T allele of rs2289105 in CYP19 gene might be a protective genetic marker of EH for women in Han population.",
      "In this study, we find that simple and complex ASEs undergo opposite selection pressure for protein reading frame preservation, with CSEs in-between. Simple ASEs have much higher FRFPs than complex ones. We further find that the FRFPs of complex ASEs coupled with flanking exons are close to those of simple ASEs, indicating that neighboring exons of an ASE may evolve in a coordinated way to avoid protein dysfunction. Therefore, we suggest that evolutionary analyses of AS should take into consideration the effects of different splicing patterns and the joint effects of multiple AS events.",
      "Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that HDGF was expressed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. High nuclear expression of HDGF was positively correlated with FIGO stage (P = 0.032), but not associated with other clinical features, such as histological grading or lymph node status. Patients with high expression of HDGF had poorer overall survival rates than those with low expression of HDGF (P = 0.001). However, multivariate analyses showed that high nuclear expression of HDGF protein was not an independent predictor of prognosis for EC patients (P = 0.111). Our results suggest that high nuclear expression of HDGF is a potential unfavorable factor for the progression and prognosis of EC.",
      "The results of our large, single-center, retrospective study suggest that the findings of a FDG-PET scan may be interesting in the initial assessment of patients with ECD, but its greater contribution is in followup of these patients.",
      "Over expression of UCP2 in certain tumors provides the rationale to speculate that UCP2 may promote tumor growth in these cancers.",
      "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading known genetic cause of autism spectrum disorders. Individuals with FXS show symptoms of auditory hypersensitivity. These symptoms may arise due to sustained neural responses to repeated sounds, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. For the first time, this study shows deficits in habituation of neural responses to repeated sounds in the Fmr1 KO mice as seen in humans with FXS. We also report an abnormally high level of matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) in the auditory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice and that deletion of Mmp-9 from Fmr1 KO mice reverses habituation deficits. These data provide a translation relevant electrophysiological biomarker for sensory deficits in FXS and implicate MMP-9 as a target for drug discovery.",
      "Prevalence of hay fever and sinusitis are correlated with air quality. Improvements in air quality are associated with decreased prevalence of both hay fever and sinusitis. Laryngoscope, 2009.",
      "S 23521 is an effective glucagon-like peptide-1-(7-36) amide analogue, which induced a decrease in energy intake, body weight, and adiposity in a rat model of diet-induced obesity. In addition, the treatment also improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity of obese rats. These results strongly support S 23521 as a putative molecule for the treatment of obesity.",
      "Our study demonstrates that the age at first exposure to T. gondii is an important factor in shaping distinct behavioral and neurobiological abnormalities. Elevation in GLUN2 autoantibodies or complement protein C1q may be a potential underlying mechanism. A better understanding of these age-related differences may lead to more efficient treatments of behavioral disorders associated with T. gondii infection.",
      "These studies indicate that the rate and extent of risedronate absorption are independent of the site of administration along the gastrointestinal tract, and that the extent of absorption is not affected by the rate of administration.",
      "These findings indicate that NGAL reduces apoptosis by regulating the four apoptosis factors Bcl-2, Bax, Fas and FasL through its two receptors 24p3R and megalin. These results also suggest that ectopic expression of NGAL in renal cells might provide a therapeutic strategy in ischemia-reperfusion by reducing apoptosis and promoting renal cell proliferation.",
      "Increased BMI is associated with increased diurnal strains in articular cartilage of both the medial and lateral compartments of the knee. The increased cartilage strains observed in individuals with high BMI may, in part, explain the elevated risk of OA associated with obesity or may reflect alterations in the cartilage mechanical properties in subjects with high BMI.",
      "The data demonstrate that EA activates the adrenals to increase plasma corticosterone levels and suppress edema and suggest that EA effects differ in healthy subjects and in those with pathologies.",
      "Measurement of pleural fluid sp185(HER-2) has poor diagnostic performance in patients with malignant effusions.",
      "TMZ and BEV can directly cause the dysfunction of mitochondria isolated from human brain tumors. However, BEV has a greater ability to disturb mitochondrial function in mitochondria isolated from human brain tumors than either TMZ or calcium overload conditions.",
      "Similar urinary flows and osmolalities are associated with levels of plasma vasopressin and renal PGE2, which are higher in males than in females. Oxytocin does not seem to play a role in the diurnal urine formation, whereas prostaglandin E2 could represent a mediator of the gender difference, not only as a mediator of the vasopressin response, but also as an independent factor. These findings need further elucidation.",
      "MICR has a very transient impact on plasma levels of endostatin and no impact on angiostatin during the first 21 days following surgery. Thus, angiostatin and endostatin do not likely contribute to or inhibit the persistent proangiogenic changes noted after MICR.",
      "Dietary guidelines for CVD risk reduction may also benefit bone health in this Hispanic cohort. Synchronizing dietary guidelines for these 2 common diseases may provide a simplified public health message. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01231958.",

      "We conclude that inhibition of TLR4 with eritoran in an in situ murine model significantly reduces MI/R injury and markers of an inflammatory response.",
      "HMbeta supplementation can increase survival time and promotes metabolic changes in cancer-bearing animals, but it seems to work in a time-dependent manner.",
      "The probability of a successful cardioversion correlates inversely with NT-proBNP values. The short-term success of a cardioversion might be predicted by prior determination of NT-proBNP.",
      "These data provide evidence that there are no obvious adverse effects of acute or more chronic Cr supplementation on the haematological indices measured, nor on hepatic, muscle, and renal function. Therefore there is no apparent health risk associated with Cr supplementation to healthy people when it is ingested in quantities that have been scientifically proven to increase muscle Cr stores.",
      "Our data provide strong evidence that both cAMP effectors, Epac and PKA, and the levels of intracellular calcium are involved in the hepatic cystogenesis of ARPKD.",
      "All together, the pharmacological reactivity of STOP null mice to antipsychotics evokes the pharmacological response of humans to such drugs. Totally, our study suggests that STOP null mice may provide a useful preclinical model to evaluate pharmacological properties of antipsychotic drugs.",
      "This study confirms that C pneumoniae is a common finding in atherosclerotic plaques of the carotid artery but suggests that the presence of the infectious organism has little detectable impact on plaque instability when measured by clinically significant markers. This raises important questions for the rationale of antibiotic therapy in atherosclerosis.",
      "Moxibustion exerted its effect on healing impaired colonic mucosa in rats with TNBS-induced colitis by increasing the degranulation ratio of local MC, but had little effect on the morphology of MC at ST25 acupoint.",
      "Laser Doppler flowmetry detected circulatory abnormalities in primary open-angle glaucoma suspects who did not have any manifest visual field defect. Decreases in flow in glaucoma suspects were similar in magnitude to those of subjects with primary open-angle glaucoma. These data suggest that impaired optic nerve blood flow develops early in the glaucomatous process and does not develop solely as a result of glaucoma damage."
