    "\n\nAnswer: No, antiangiogenic therapy of cerebral melanoma metastases does not result in sustained tumor progression via vessel co-option.\n\nExplanation: Antiangiogenic therapy is a treatment that aims to inhibit the formation of new blood vessels in tumors. Cerebral melanoma metastases are tumors that have spread from the original melanoma in the skin to the brain. Vessel co-option is a process in which tumors use existing blood vessels in the surrounding tissue to supply nutrients and oxygen.\n\nStudies have shown that antiangiogenic therapy can effectively inhibit tumor growth and reduce the formation of new blood vessels in cerebral melanoma metastases. However, the studies have also shown that tumors can adapt to the treatment by using existing blood vessels in the surrounding tissue to supply nutrients and oxygen, a process known as vessel co-option.\n\nTherefore, antiangiogenic therapy of cerebral melanoma metastases does not result in sustained tumor progression via vessel co-option. Instead, the treatment can effectively inhibit tumor growth and reduce the formation of new blood vessels in the tumor.",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, patient-prosthesis mismatch in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement can affect survival. Studies have shown that aortic stenosis patients with a patient-prosthesis mismatch have a higher risk of mortality and morbidity compared to those without a mismatch. This is because aortic stenosis is a condition where the aortic valve narrows, making it harder for blood to flow through the heart and into the aorta. When a prosthetic valve is implanted to replace the aortic valve, it is important to ensure that the prosthetic valve is the right size and type for the patient's aortic annulus. A mismatch can occur when the prosthetic valve is too small or too large for the aortic annulus, leading to problems such as regurgitation, stenosis, and other complications. Therefore, it is important for healthcare providers to carefully evaluate the patient's aortic annulus and choose a prosthetic valve that is the best match for the patient's anatomy to minimize the risk of patient-prosthesis mismatch and improve survival outcomes.",

    "\n\nAnswer: The long-term reversal of hypocholesterolaemia in patients with chronic hepatitis C is related to sustained viral response and viral genotype. Hypocholesterolaemia is a condition characterized by low levels of cholesterol in the blood. It is commonly seen in patients with chronic hepatitis C, a viral infection that affects the liver. The long-term reversal of hypocholesterolaemia in these patients is related to sustained viral response, which means that the virus has been eliminated from the body and the liver function has improved. The viral genotype, or the specific type of virus present in the body, also plays a role in the long-term reversal of hypocholesterolaemia. Some viral genotypes are more likely to respond to antiviral treatment and lead to sustained viral response, while others may be less responsive and may not lead to sustained viral response. Therefore, the long-term reversal of hypocholesterolaemia in patients with chronic hepatitis C is related to both sustained viral response and viral genotype.",

      "Our data show that, although angiogenesis can be effectively blocked by ZD6474, in vessel-dense organs this may result in sustained tumor progression via co-option, rather than in tumor dormancy. Importantly, blocking VEGF-A may result in undetectability of tumors in CE-MRI scans, leading to erroneous conclusions about therapeutic efficacy during magnetic resonance imaging follow-up. The maintenance of VEGF-A-induced vessel leakage in the absence of neovascularization at lower ZD6474 doses may be exploited to improve delivery of chemotherapeutic agents in combined treatment regimens of antiangiogenic and chemotherapeutic compounds.",

This study successfully illustrated the power of lipidomics in unraveling intervention effects and to help finding new targets or ingredients for lifestyle-related metabolic abnormality.",
      "Expression of nm23-H1/NDP kinase is strongly upregulated in most EOCs. Redundant overexpression of nm23-H1/NDP kinase may contribute to deranged cell cycle progression and EOC proliferation. Pattern and intensity of nm23-H1/NDP kinase immunostaining of EOC tissue retrieved at primary operation may identify patients at risk for tumor progression and help guide treatment strategies. These findings suggest that nm23-H1 gene expression may have distinct if not opposite biologic functions in EOC and breast carcinoma.",
      "These results suggest that LTB(4) may enhance TNF-alpha-induced CCL27 production by activating NF-kappaB via the BLT1/G(i/o)/PI3K/ERK pathway in human keratinocytes. LTB(4) may contribute to the enhanced CCL27 production of keratinocytes in lesions with atopic dermatitis or allergic contact dermatitis.",

We conclude that the induction of oral tolerance to oxLDL may be a promising strategy to modulate the immune response during atherogenesis and a new way to treat atherosclerosis.",
      "The expected sex-based less atherogenic lipoprotein cholesterol distribution was not seen in women with type 1 diabetes. Moreover, insulin resistance was associated with a more atherogenic lipoprotein cholesterol distribution in all men and in women with type 1 diabetes.

Furthermore, continued participation in weight-bearing exercise in early to mid-adulthood appears to be important for reducing the risk of low bone strength in old age.",
      "Unlike in mild and relatively early STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy, scarring of severely and chronically damaged kidneys is not attenuated by a 50% reduction of CCN2 to (near) normal levels. This suggests that CCN2 is either redundant in severe and chronic kidney disease, or that it is a limiting factor only at subnormal concentrations requiring further reduction by available or emerging therapies to prevent fibrosis of the severely injured kidney.",

      "A confirmation of the hypothesis would support efforts to generate a P. falciparum vaccine containing a comprehensive set of blood stage antigens, which, using adjuvant technology, would lead to the appropriate immunoglobulin subclass response. MEANS TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS: Detection of multiple immunorelevant P. falciparum blood stage antigens could be achieved by two-dimensional electrophoresis and blotting of the antigens onto nitrocellulose followed by exposure to the participant's serum. Bound immunoglobulins are visualized by isotype specific peroxidase conjugated anti-human immunoglobulin and quantified by transmission densitometry. The resulting pattern of responses for each immunoglobulin isotype could be compared between clinically immune participants remaining asymptomatic with subsequent P. falciparum infections and people who develop malaria. Immunorelevant antigens are identifiable by mass spectrometry with the fully decoded P. falciparum genome.",
      "Results indicated that the involvement of multiple recombination detection programs is very necessary. Additionally, results suggested two major challenges, one involving the difficulty of accurately determining the locations of breakpoints and the second involving identification of small regions of about 200 bases or fewer with greater caution. Both indicate the complexity of HIV-1 recombination. The resolution would depend critically on development of a recombination analysis algorithm, accumulation of HIV-1 stains, and a higher sequencing quality. With the changes in recombination pattern, phylogenetic relationships of some CRFs may also change. All these results may be critical to understand the role of recombination in a complex and dynamic HIV evolution.",

      "In households where food insecurity exists, knowledge of care practices may not be sufficient, and interventions such as food subsidies must precede or accompany educational efforts. Further follow-up is required to explore the effect of gender differences on child care.",
      "Stroke acutely activates the TLR signaling pathway on cerebral vasculature. Upregulation of miR-146a and inactivation of ischemia and tPA-potentiated TLR signaling pathway by VELCADE may play an important role in the neuroprotective effect of the combination therapy of VELCADE and tPA for acute stroke.",
      "Early life weight gain was negatively associated with flow indices in adolescence, suggesting structural changes in peripheral lungs.",

      "In this population, which included a high percentage of patients with luminal cancers, pCR did not predict for improved OS. Postneoadjuvant chemotherapy showed no discernible benefit even in subgroups with aggressive tumor biology or significant remaining tumor burden. The use of such treatment should therefore be discouraged outside of clinical trials.",
      "These findings suggest that LRRK2 dimerization and autophosphorylation may be required for the neurotoxicity of LRRK2 PD mutations and highlight a potential role for the WD40 domain in the mechanism of LRRK2-mediated cell death.",

      "Circulating AFABP, produced by adipocytes and macrophages, and lipocalin-2, produced by multiple tissues, are elevated and may contribute to the metabolic syndrome in NAFLD. AFABP levels, which correlate with subcutaneous, but not visceral fat, independently predict inflammation and fibrosis in NAFLD and may have a direct pathogenic link to disease progression.",
      "Increased timing variability in people with AD occurs during gait initiation as well as during constant speed walking and is evident in the early disease stages.",
      "The relatively few differences observed imply that pitching biomechanics remained remarkably similar between collegiate starting pitchers who threw between 105 and 135 pitches for 7 to 9 innings and approached muscular fatigue.",
      "Pamidronate presents antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory properties in 3 different models of experimental colitis in rodents. This effect requires oral administration and may involve T cells in the gut mucosa, although the exact mechanism is unclear.",
      "Spatial hearing skills in sequentially implanted children develop in an experience-dependent manner, perhaps because of the ability of the auditory system to use newly acquired electrical stimulation presented to the 2 ears.",
      "We suggest that the combination of GM-CSF with appropriate antibiotics can resolve EG and avoid or minimize the risk of septicemia in immunosuppressed patients.",
      "Pterygium is related to a decrease in corneal ECD. Surgical intervention should be considered in patients with extensive pterygium involvement in the cornea or a significant increase in astigmatism.",
      "Besides causing hepatic steatosis, genotype-3 specifically decreases serum cholesterol. This interference with the metabolic lipid pathway is related to viral load, is reversed with sustained viral response, and seems unrelated to mitochondrial dysfunction.",

      "The T allele of rs2289105 in CYP19 gene might be a protective genetic marker of EH for women in Han population.",
      "In this study, we find that simple and complex ASEs undergo opposite selection pressure for protein reading frame preservation, with CSEs in-between. Simple ASEs have much higher FRFPs than complex ones. We further find that the FRFPs of complex ASEs coupled with flanking exons are close to those of simple ASEs, indicating that neighboring exons of an ASE may evolve in a coordinated way to avoid protein dysfunction. Therefore, we suggest that evolutionary analyses of AS should take into consideration the effects of different splicing patterns and the joint effects of multiple AS events.",
      "Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that HDGF was expressed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. High nuclear expression of HDGF was positively correlated with FIGO stage (P = 0.032), but not associated with other clinical features, such as histological grading or lymph node status. Patients with high expression of HDGF had poorer overall survival rates than those with low expression of HDGF (P = 0.001). However, multivariate analyses showed that high nuclear expression of HDGF protein was not an independent predictor of prognosis for EC patients (P = 0.111). Our results suggest that high nuclear expression of HDGF is a potential unfavorable factor for the progression and prognosis of EC.",
      "The results of our large, single-center, retrospective study suggest that the findings of a FDG-PET scan may be interesting in the initial assessment of patients with ECD, but its greater contribution is in followup of these patients.",
      "Over expression of UCP2 in certain tumors provides the rationale to speculate that UCP2 may promote tumor growth in these cancers.",
      "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading known genetic cause of autism spectrum disorders. Individuals with FXS show symptoms of auditory hypersensitivity. These symptoms may arise due to sustained neural responses to repeated sounds, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. For the first time, this study shows deficits in habituation of neural responses to repeated sounds in the Fmr1 KO mice as seen in humans with FXS. We also report an abnormally high level of matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) in the auditory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice and that deletion of Mmp-9 from Fmr1 KO mice reverses habituation deficits. These data provide a translation relevant electrophysiological biomarker for sensory deficits in FXS and implicate MMP-9 as a target for drug discovery.",
      "Prevalence of hay fever and sinusitis are correlated with air quality. Improvements in air quality are associated with decreased prevalence of both hay fever and sinusitis. Laryngoscope, 2009.",
      "S 23521 is an effective glucagon-like peptide-1-(7-36) amide analogue, which induced a decrease in energy intake, body weight, and adiposity in a rat model of diet-induced obesity. In addition, the treatment also improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity of obese rats. These results strongly support S 23521 as a putative molecule for the treatment of obesity.",
      "Our study demonstrates that the age at first exposure to T. gondii is an important factor in shaping distinct behavioral and neurobiological abnormalities. Elevation in GLUN2 autoantibodies or complement protein C1q may be a potential underlying mechanism. A better understanding of these age-related differences may lead to more efficient treatments of behavioral disorders associated with T. gondii infection.",
      "These studies indicate that the rate and extent of risedronate absorption are independent of the site of administration along the gastrointestinal tract, and that the extent of absorption is not affected by the rate of administration.",
      "These findings indicate that NGAL reduces apoptosis by regulating the four apoptosis factors Bcl-2, Bax, Fas and FasL through its two receptors 24p3R and megalin. These results also suggest that ectopic expression of NGAL in renal cells might provide a therapeutic strategy in ischemia-reperfusion by reducing apoptosis and promoting renal cell proliferation.",
      "Increased BMI is associated with increased diurnal strains in articular cartilage of both the medial and lateral compartments of the knee. The increased cartilage strains observed in individuals with high BMI may, in part, explain the elevated risk of OA associated with obesity or may reflect alterations in the cartilage mechanical properties in subjects with high BMI.",
      "The data demonstrate that EA activates the adrenals to increase plasma corticosterone levels and suppress edema and suggest that EA effects differ in healthy subjects and in those with pathologies.",
      "Measurement of pleural fluid sp185(HER-2) has poor diagnostic performance in patients with malignant effusions.",
      "TMZ and BEV can directly cause the dysfunction of mitochondria isolated from human brain tumors. However, BEV has a greater ability to disturb mitochondrial function in mitochondria isolated from human brain tumors than either TMZ or calcium overload conditions.",
      "Similar urinary flows and osmolalities are associated with levels of plasma vasopressin and renal PGE2, which are higher in males than in females. Oxytocin does not seem to play a role in the diurnal urine formation, whereas prostaglandin E2 could represent a mediator of the gender difference, not only as a mediator of the vasopressin response, but also as an independent factor. These findings need further elucidation.",
      "MICR has a very transient impact on plasma levels of endostatin and no impact on angiostatin during the first 21 days following surgery. Thus, angiostatin and endostatin do not likely contribute to or inhibit the persistent proangiogenic changes noted after MICR.",
      "Dietary guidelines for CVD risk reduction may also benefit bone health in this Hispanic cohort. Synchronizing dietary guidelines for these 2 common diseases may provide a simplified public health message. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01231958.",
      "Basophils may worsen Th2 inflammatory disorders through direct interactions with pathogenic CD4 T cells as well as by enhancing DC-induced Th2 cell development.",
      "We conclude that inhibition of TLR4 with eritoran in an in situ murine model significantly reduces MI/R injury and markers of an inflammatory response.",
      "HMbeta supplementation can increase survival time and promotes metabolic changes in cancer-bearing animals, but it seems to work in a time-dependent manner.",
      "The probability of a successful cardioversion correlates inversely with NT-proBNP values. The short-term success of a cardioversion might be predicted by prior determination of NT-proBNP.",
      "These data provide evidence that there are no obvious adverse effects of acute or more chronic Cr supplementation on the haematological indices measured, nor on hepatic, muscle, and renal function. Therefore there is no apparent health risk associated with Cr supplementation to healthy people when it is ingested in quantities that have been scientifically proven to increase muscle Cr stores.",
      "Our data provide strong evidence that both cAMP effectors, Epac and PKA, and the levels of intracellular calcium are involved in the hepatic cystogenesis of ARPKD.",
      "All together, the pharmacological reactivity of STOP null mice to antipsychotics evokes the pharmacological response of humans to such drugs. Totally, our study suggests that STOP null mice may provide a useful preclinical model to evaluate pharmacological properties of antipsychotic drugs.",
      "This study confirms that C pneumoniae is a common finding in atherosclerotic plaques of the carotid artery but suggests that the presence of the infectious organism has little detectable impact on plaque instability when measured by clinically significant markers. This raises important questions for the rationale of antibiotic therapy in atherosclerosis.",
      "Moxibustion exerted its effect on healing impaired colonic mucosa in rats with TNBS-induced colitis by increasing the degranulation ratio of local MC, but had little effect on the morphology of MC at ST25 acupoint.",
      "Laser Doppler flowmetry detected circulatory abnormalities in primary open-angle glaucoma suspects who did not have any manifest visual field defect. Decreases in flow in glaucoma suspects were similar in magnitude to those of subjects with primary open-angle glaucoma. These data suggest that impaired optic nerve blood flow develops early in the glaucomatous process and does not develop solely as a result of glaucoma damage."
