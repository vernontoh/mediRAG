    "\n\nAnswer:\nNo, Antiangiogenic therapy of cerebral melanoma metastases does not result in sustained tumor progression via vessel co-option.\n\nExplanation:\nThe study found that antiangiogenic treatment inhibited the progression of leptomeningeal tumors in a mouse model of cerebral melanoma metastases. However, the study also found that the tumors continued to grow and progress despite the antiangiogenic treatment. This suggests that the tumors were able to adapt to the lack of new blood vessels and continue to grow by using existing vessels. The study also found that the tumors were able to invade and grow in the brain tissue, suggesting that the tumors were able to adapt to the unique environment of the brain.\n\nOverall, the study suggests that antiangiogenic therapy of cerebral melanoma metastases may not be effective in the long term, as the tumors may be able to adapt and continue to grow despite the treatment. Further research is needed to better understand the mechanisms underlying tumor progression in the brain and to develop more effective treatments for cerebral melanoma metastases.",

    "\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe study suggests that non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) impair insulin-mediated glucose uptake and disposition in the liver. The study found that NEFA suppression during the OGTT was decreased in subjects with severe fatty liver, and the insulin sensitivity index for NEFA was decreased in all three groups of subjects with fatty liver. The study also found that whole-body glucose disposal was inversely associated with fatty liver, suggesting that fatty liver impairs glucose uptake and disposition in the liver.\n\nThe study also suggests that the effect of NEFAs on insulin-mediated glucose uptake and disposition in the liver may be independent of whole-body glucose production and disposal measurements. The study found that NEFA concentrations were associated with fatty liver independently of whole-body glucose production and disposal measurements.\n\nOverall, the study provides evidence that non-esterified fatty acids impair insulin-mediated glucose uptake and disposition in the liver, and that this effect may be independent of whole-body glucose production and disposal measurements.",

    "\n\nAnswer: Yes, the present study tested the hypothesis that rosuvastatin treatment may attenuate left ventricular (LV) remodelling and dysfunction in the failing heart, which may be associated with alterations of Ca(2+)-regulatory protein. The study found that rosuvastatin prevented the decrease of SERCA2a and pSer16-PLB expression, increased SERCA activity, but showed no effect on PLB expression. Furthermore, rosuvastatin reduced the increased IL-6 level and further elevated IL-10 level in the peri-infarct and remote zones of MI. These findings suggest that the beneficial effect of rosuvastatin on cardiac dysfunction may be associated with alterations in calcium-regulatory proteins.",

    "\n\nAnswer:\nYes, Xenon pretreatment attenuates anesthetic-induced apoptosis in the developing brain in comparison with nitrous oxide and hypoxia.\n\nExplanation:\nThe current study investigated xenon's putative protective properties against anesthetic-induced neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain. Xenon pretreatment prevented nitrous oxide- and isoflurane-induced neuroapoptosis (in vivo and in vitro) and cognitive deterioration (in vivo). In contrast, nitrous oxide- and isoflurane-induced neuroapoptosis was exacerbated by hypoxic pretreatment. Nitrous oxide pretreatment had no effect. Xenon pretreatment increased Bcl-2 expression and decreased both cytochrome C release and P53 expression; conversely, the opposite was evident after hypoxic pretreatment.

      "Early life weight gain was negatively associated with flow indices in adolescence, suggesting structural changes in peripheral lungs.",
      "SAMC is a novel hepato-protective agent against NAFLD caused by abnormal liver functions. Garlic or garlic derivatives could be considered as a potent food supplement in the prevention of fatty liver disease.",
      "An increased chest compression fraction is independently predictive of better survival in patients who experience a prehospital ventricular fibrillation/tachycardia cardiac arrest.",
      "Snail is expressed in pancreatic cancer; it confers enhanced invasive ability and chemoresistance to pancreatic cancer cells. Snail may be a marker for predicting the malignancy of pancreatic cancer. Further therapy target to Snail may be of great benefit to pancreatic cancer patients.",
      "Slug down-regulation promotes cell apoptosis and decreases invasion capability in vitro and in vivo. Slug inhibition may represent a novel strategy for treatment of metastatic ESCC.",
      "In this population, which included a high percentage of patients with luminal cancers, pCR did not predict for improved OS. Postneoadjuvant chemotherapy showed no discernible benefit even in subgroups with aggressive tumor biology or significant remaining tumor burden. The use of such treatment should therefore be discouraged outside of clinical trials.",
      "These findings suggest that LRRK2 dimerization and autophosphorylation may be required for the neurotoxicity of LRRK2 PD mutations and highlight a potential role for the WD40 domain in the mechanism of LRRK2-mediated cell death.",
      "Inhibition of leukocyte function with MoAb 60.3 does not afford protection from severe focal ischemia and reperfusion in cats.",
      "We propose that prenatal LPS exposure on GD21 acts as an imprinting factor that interferes with the programming of brain sexual determination in offspring.",
      "Circulating AFABP, produced by adipocytes and macrophages, and lipocalin-2, produced by multiple tissues, are elevated and may contribute to the metabolic syndrome in NAFLD. AFABP levels, which correlate with subcutaneous, but not visceral fat, independently predict inflammation and fibrosis in NAFLD and may have a direct pathogenic link to disease progression.",
      "Increased timing variability in people with AD occurs during gait initiation as well as during constant speed walking and is evident in the early disease stages.",
      "The relatively few differences observed imply that pitching biomechanics remained remarkably similar between collegiate starting pitchers who threw between 105 and 135 pitches for 7 to 9 innings and approached muscular fatigue.",
      "Pamidronate presents antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory properties in 3 different models of experimental colitis in rodents. This effect requires oral administration and may involve T cells in the gut mucosa, although the exact mechanism is unclear.",
      "Spatial hearing skills in sequentially implanted children develop in an experience-dependent manner, perhaps because of the ability of the auditory system to use newly acquired electrical stimulation presented to the 2 ears.",
      "We suggest that the combination of GM-CSF with appropriate antibiotics can resolve EG and avoid or minimize the risk of septicemia in immunosuppressed patients.",
      "Pterygium is related to a decrease in corneal ECD. Surgical intervention should be considered in patients with extensive pterygium involvement in the cornea or a significant increase in astigmatism.",
      "Besides causing hepatic steatosis, genotype-3 specifically decreases serum cholesterol. This interference with the metabolic lipid pathway is related to viral load, is reversed with sustained viral response, and seems unrelated to mitochondrial dysfunction.",
      "The intervention program resulted in significant reductions of cathepsin L and S levels in plasma after 4 and 8 weeks of intervention.",
      "The T allele of rs2289105 in CYP19 gene might be a protective genetic marker of EH for women in Han population.",
      "In this study, we find that simple and complex ASEs undergo opposite selection pressure for protein reading frame preservation, with CSEs in-between. Simple ASEs have much higher FRFPs than complex ones. We further find that the FRFPs of complex ASEs coupled with flanking exons are close to those of simple ASEs, indicating that neighboring exons of an ASE may evolve in a coordinated way to avoid protein dysfunction. Therefore, we suggest that evolutionary analyses of AS should take into consideration the effects of different splicing patterns and the joint effects of multiple AS events.",
      "Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that HDGF was expressed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. High nuclear expression of HDGF was positively correlated with FIGO stage (P = 0.032), but not associated with other clinical features, such as histological grading or lymph node status. Patients with high expression of HDGF had poorer overall survival rates than those with low expression of HDGF (P = 0.001). However, multivariate analyses showed that high nuclear expression of HDGF protein was not an independent predictor of prognosis for EC patients (P = 0.111). Our results suggest that high nuclear expression of HDGF is a potential unfavorable factor for the progression and prognosis of EC.",
      "The results of our large, single-center, retrospective study suggest that the findings of a FDG-PET scan may be interesting in the initial assessment of patients with ECD, but its greater contribution is in followup of these patients.",
      "Over expression of UCP2 in certain tumors provides the rationale to speculate that UCP2 may promote tumor growth in these cancers.",
      "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading known genetic cause of autism spectrum disorders. Individuals with FXS show symptoms of auditory hypersensitivity. These symptoms may arise due to sustained neural responses to repeated sounds, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. For the first time, this study shows deficits in habituation of neural responses to repeated sounds in the Fmr1 KO mice as seen in humans with FXS. We also report an abnormally high level of matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) in the auditory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice and that deletion of Mmp-9 from Fmr1 KO mice reverses habituation deficits. These data provide a translation relevant electrophysiological biomarker for sensory deficits in FXS and implicate MMP-9 as a target for drug discovery.",
      "Prevalence of hay fever and sinusitis are correlated with air quality. Improvements in air quality are associated with decreased prevalence of both hay fever and sinusitis. Laryngoscope, 2009.",
      "S 23521 is an effective glucagon-like peptide-1-(7-36) amide analogue, which induced a decrease in energy intake, body weight, and adiposity in a rat model of diet-induced obesity. In addition, the treatment also improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity of obese rats. These results strongly support S 23521 as a putative molecule for the treatment of obesity.",
      "Our study demonstrates that the age at first exposure to T. gondii is an important factor in shaping distinct behavioral and neurobiological abnormalities. Elevation in GLUN2 autoantibodies or complement protein C1q may be a potential underlying mechanism. A better understanding of these age-related differences may lead to more efficient treatments of behavioral disorders associated with T. gondii infection.",
      "These studies indicate that the rate and extent of risedronate absorption are independent of the site of administration along the gastrointestinal tract, and that the extent of absorption is not affected by the rate of administration.",
      "These findings indicate that NGAL reduces apoptosis by regulating the four apoptosis factors Bcl-2, Bax, Fas and FasL through its two receptors 24p3R and megalin. These results also suggest that ectopic expression of NGAL in renal cells might provide a therapeutic strategy in ischemia-reperfusion by reducing apoptosis and promoting renal cell proliferation.",
      "Increased BMI is associated with increased diurnal strains in articular cartilage of both the medial and lateral compartments of the knee. The increased cartilage strains observed in individuals with high BMI may, in part, explain the elevated risk of OA associated with obesity or may reflect alterations in the cartilage mechanical properties in subjects with high BMI.",
      "The data demonstrate that EA activates the adrenals to increase plasma corticosterone levels and suppress edema and suggest that EA effects differ in healthy subjects and in those with pathologies.",
      "Measurement of pleural fluid sp185(HER-2) has poor diagnostic performance in patients with malignant effusions.",
      "TMZ and BEV can directly cause the dysfunction of mitochondria isolated from human brain tumors. However, BEV has a greater ability to disturb mitochondrial function in mitochondria isolated from human brain tumors than either TMZ or calcium overload conditions.",
      "Similar urinary flows and osmolalities are associated with levels of plasma vasopressin and renal PGE2, which are higher in males than in females. Oxytocin does not seem to play a role in the diurnal urine formation, whereas prostaglandin E2 could represent a mediator of the gender difference, not only as a mediator of the vasopressin response, but also as an independent factor. These findings need further elucidation.",
      "MICR has a very transient impact on plasma levels of endostatin and no impact on angiostatin during the first 21 days following surgery. Thus, angiostatin and endostatin do not likely contribute to or inhibit the persistent proangiogenic changes noted after MICR.",
      "Dietary guidelines for CVD risk reduction may also benefit bone health in this Hispanic cohort. Synchronizing dietary guidelines for these 2 common diseases may provide a simplified public health message. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01231958.",
      "Basophils may worsen Th2 inflammatory disorders through direct interactions with pathogenic CD4 T cells as well as by enhancing DC-induced Th2 cell development.",
      "We conclude that inhibition of TLR4 with eritoran in an in situ murine model significantly reduces MI/R injury and markers of an inflammatory response.",
      "HMbeta supplementation can increase survival time and promotes metabolic changes in cancer-bearing animals, but it seems to work in a time-dependent manner.",
      "The probability of a successful cardioversion correlates inversely with NT-proBNP values. The short-term success of a cardioversion might be predicted by prior determination of NT-proBNP.",
      "These data provide evidence that there are no obvious adverse effects of acute or more chronic Cr supplementation on the haematological indices measured, nor on hepatic, muscle, and renal function. Therefore there is no apparent health risk associated with Cr supplementation to healthy people when it is ingested in quantities that have been scientifically proven to increase muscle Cr stores.",
      "Our data provide strong evidence that both cAMP effectors, Epac and PKA, and the levels of intracellular calcium are involved in the hepatic cystogenesis of ARPKD.",
      "All together, the pharmacological reactivity of STOP null mice to antipsychotics evokes the pharmacological response of humans to such drugs. Totally, our study suggests that STOP null mice may provide a useful preclinical model to evaluate pharmacological properties of antipsychotic drugs.",
      "This study confirms that C pneumoniae is a common finding in atherosclerotic plaques of the carotid artery but suggests that the presence of the infectious organism has little detectable impact on plaque instability when measured by clinically significant markers. This raises important questions for the rationale of antibiotic therapy in atherosclerosis.",
      "Moxibustion exerted its effect on healing impaired colonic mucosa in rats with TNBS-induced colitis by increasing the degranulation ratio of local MC, but had little effect on the morphology of MC at ST25 acupoint.",
      "Laser Doppler flowmetry detected circulatory abnormalities in primary open-angle glaucoma suspects who did not have any manifest visual field defect. Decreases in flow in glaucoma suspects were similar in magnitude to those of subjects with primary open-angle glaucoma. These data suggest that impaired optic nerve blood flow develops early in the glaucomatous process and does not develop solely as a result of glaucoma damage."
