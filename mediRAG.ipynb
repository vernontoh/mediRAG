It has been linked to prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) and has been proposed as a risk factor for substance use initiation. However, there is limited research on whether NBD predicts substance use initiation in children with PCE.\\n\\nMethods: This study examined whether NBD predicted substance use initiation in a sample of children with PCE. Participants were recruited from a longitudinal study of children born to cocaine-using mothers. NBD was assessed using the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) at age 5 and substance use was assessed using self-report questionnaires at age 12. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between NBD and substance use initiation.\\n\\nResults: The sample included 100 children with PCE and 100 children without PCE. NBD was significantly higher in the PCE group compared to the non-PCE group at age 5 (t(199) = 2.50, p < .05). Logistic regression analyses revealed that NBD predicted substance use initiation in the PCE group (OR = 1.40, 9'"
