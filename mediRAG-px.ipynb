      "Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a common form of heart failure characterized by impaired left ventricular (LV) diastolic function and normal or near-normal LV ejection fraction [1]. The pathophysiology of HFpEF is complex and involves both structural and functional changes in the heart [2]. Recent studies have shown that HFpEF is associated with dynamic impairment of active relaxation and contraction of the LV on exercise, which may be related to myocardial energy deficiency [3]. This review summarizes the current evidence on the dynamic impairment of LV function in HFpEF and its association with myocardial energy deficiency [1]. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a common form of heart failure characterized by impaired left ventricular (LV) diastolic function and normal or near-normal LV ejection fraction [0]. HFpEF is estimated to affect 50% of all patients with heart failure, and its prevalence is increasing with age [4]. The pathophysiology of HFpEF is complex and involves both structural and functional changes in the heart [1]. Recent studies have shown that HFpEF is associated with dynamic impairment of active relaxation and contraction of the LV on exercise, which may be related to myocardial [2]. \n",

      "[2] Patients with HFpEF (n=17) and control subjects without heart failure (n=19) generally matched for age, gender, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy underwent maximal-effort upright cycle ergometry with radionuclide ventriculography to determine rest and exercise cardiovascular function. Resting cardiovascular function was similar between the 2 groups. Both had limited exercise capacity, but this was more profoundly reduced in HFpEF patients (exercise duration 180+/-71 versus 455+/-184 seconds; peak oxygen consumption 9.0+/-3.4 versus 14.4+/-3.4 mL x kg(-1) x min(-1); both P<0.001). At matched low-level workload, HFpEF subjects displayed approximately 40% less of an increase in heart rate and cardiac output and less systemic vasodilation (all P<0.05) despite a similar rise in end-diastolic volume, stroke volume, and contractility. Heart rate recovery after exercise was also significantly delayed in HFpEF patients. Exercise capacity correlated with the\n",

However, recent studies have suggested that dynamic impairment of active relaxation and contraction of the LV on exercise could also contribute to exercise intolerance in patients with HFpEF.\\n\\nAdditionally, myocardial energy deficiency has been associated with HFpEF.
