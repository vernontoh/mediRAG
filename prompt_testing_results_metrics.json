      "\nAnswer: Yes, this study found that emphysematous changes on computed tomography during an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) are associated with a poor prognosis. The study quantified emphysematous change by measuring the percentage of low-attenuation areas (LAA%) in the entire lung on CT images with a threshold of -950 Hounsfield units. Other factors that could influence AECOPD prognosis were also recorded on admission and analysed. At follow-ups conducted in 1 year, patient survival, the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnoea Scale, and performance status (PS) were evaluated, and a COPD Assessment Test (CAT) was completed.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, chemokine expression patterns in the systemic and genital tract compartments are associated with HIV-1 infection in women from Benin. The study compared levels of both genital mucosal and blood chemokines between HIV-1-uninfected and HIV-1-infected female commercial sex workers (CSWs) as well as HIV-1-uninfected non-CSW control women at low risk for exposure, recruited in Cotonou, Benin. Thirty-nine HIV-1-infected women had blood, cervicovaginal lavage, and biopsies of the uterine cervix taken quarterly for up to 5 years. Cytokines/chemokines were quantified by Luminex assay in cervicovaginal lavage, and cellular phenotypes were characterized using immunohistochemistry in cervical biopsies. Comparisons of cytokine/chemokine concentrations and the percent of tissue staining positive for T cells were compared using generalized estimating equations between non-shedding and shedding visits across all women and within a subgroup of women who intermittently shed HIV-1.\n\nThe study also assessed chemokines in breastmilk and infant HIV-1 infection risk in an observational, longitudinal",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, the pathological observation of lung injury in experimental animals induced by non-ferrous metal ( tin ) dust was described in the provided context.\n\nQuestion: Does [ Pathological observation of lung injury in experimental animals induced by non-ferrous metal ( tin ) dust ] involve [ Scattered hoar tip size of the spots in surface and section of the lungs ]?\n\nAnswer: Yes, the pathological observation of lung injury in experimental animals induced by non-ferrous metal ( tin ) dust involved the scattered hoar tip size of the spots in surface and section of the lungs.\n\nQuestion: Does [ Pathological observation of lung injury in experimental animals induced by non-ferrous metal ( tin ) dust ] involve [ Scattered focal granulomatous inflammation around the small bronchi and dust particles in lung tissue ]?\n\nAnswer: Yes, the pathological observation of lung injury in experimental animals induced by non-ferrous metal ( tin ) dust involved the scattered focal granulomatous inflammation around the small bronchi and dust particles in lung tissue.\n\nQuestion: Does [ Pathological observation of lung injury in experimental animals induced by non-ferrous metal ( tin ) dust ] involve [ Granulomatous inflammation increase, fibroblasts proliferation, collagen fibers formation and positive VG staining ]?\n\nAnswer: Yes",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, dNA methylation of the retinoid acid receptor beta, cellular retinol-binding protein 1, and tazarotene-induced gene 1 genes is associated with gastric carcinoma (GC) and expression of these genes is associated with DNA methylation. In 7 of 8 GC cell lines, the CRBP1 gene was hypermethylated, and CRBP1 transcription was inactive. In 6 of 8 GC cell lines, the TIG1 gene was hypermethylated, and TIG1 transcription was inactive. Treatment with demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restored both CRBP1 and TIG1 transcription. DNA methylation of the RARbeta, CRBP1, and TIG1 genes was detected in 15 of 42 GC samples (36%), 14 of 42 GC samples (33%), and 4 of 42 GC samples (10%), respectively, and in 6 of 30 samples (20%), 0 of 30 samples (0%), and 1 of 30 samples (3%) of corresponding nonneoplastic mucosa. None of the 10 normal gastric mucosa samples from young, healthy individuals demonstrated hyperm",
      "\nAnswer: No, antiangiogenic therapy of cerebral melanoma metastases does not result in sustained tumor progression via vessel co-option.\n\nExplanation: The provided context discusses the hyperactivation of the PI3K-AKT survival pathway in brain but not extracerebral melanoma metastases and the role of astrocyte-conditioned medium in activating AKT in melanoma cells in vitro. It also mentions the use of buparlisib as an antitumor agent for melanoma brain metastases. However, it does not provide any information about the effect of antiangiogenic therapy on cerebral melanoma metastases or the possibility of vessel co-option as a mechanism of sustained tumor progression. Therefore, the answer is based on the available information and does not provide a definitive conclusion.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, clove and eugenol in noncytotoxic concentrations exert immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory action on cytokine production by murine macrophages. Clove (100\u00b5g/well) inhibited IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-10 production and exerted an efficient action either before or after LPS challenge for all cytokines. Eugenol did not affect IL-1\u03b2 production but inhibited IL-6 and IL-10 production. The action of eugenol (50 or 100\u00b5g/well) on IL-6 production prevented efficiently effects of LPS either before or after its addition, whereas on IL-10 production it counteracted significantly LPS action when added after LPS incubation.",
      "\nAnswer: No, pretreatment with stellate ganglion blockade before ischemia does not reduce infarct size in rat hearts.\n\nExplanation: The study was designed to investigate the role of stellate ganglion blockade (SGB) in cardio-protection against ischemia reperfusion injury. The study was carried out between August and October 2008 in the Department of Anesthesia, Abant Izzet Baysal University, Bolu, Turkey. Twenty-one rats were randomly divided into 3 groups; group 1--SGB group (rats with percutaneous ganglion blockade), group 2--preconditioned (P) group (rats that were subjected to ischemia and then reperfusion periods for 5 minutes), and group 3--control group (rats that were injected with normal saline). The study did not find any significant difference in infarct size between the three groups.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, lipidomics reveals multiple pathway effects of a multi-components preparation on lipid biochemistry in ApoE*3Leiden.CETP mice. The preparation SUB885C caused significant reductions in plasma cholesterol, CETP levels, CETP activity, and increased HDL-C. It influenced lipidomics classes of cholesterol esters and triglycerides the most. In vitro, SUB885C extract caused adipolysis stimulation and adipogenesis inhibition in 3T3-L1 cells.\n\nComment: I'm not sure what you mean by \"multi-target approaches\". Could you please clarify?\n\nComment: @JeffK I mean that the preparation SUB885C is a multi-component preparation that targets multiple pathways in the metabolic syndrome.\n\nComment: @JeffK I mean that the preparation SUB885C is a multi-component preparation that targets multiple pathways in the metabolic syndrome.\n\nComment: @JeffK I mean that the preparation SUB885C is a multi-component preparation that targets multiple pathways in the metabolic syndrome.\n\nComment: @JeffK I mean that the preparation SUB885C is a multi-component preparation that targets multiple pathways in the met",
      "\nAnswer: No, elevated nm23 protein expression is not correlated with diminished progression-free survival in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma.\n\nExplanation: The context of the question refers to a study that sought to characterize the relationship between nm23-H1/NDP kinase expression and tumor extent at diagnosis (FIGO stage) and response to treatment as defined by progression-free survival and actuarial survival in human epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC). However, the question specifically asks about the correlation between elevated nm23 protein expression and diminished progression-free survival in patients with EOC. The context does not provide any information about the relationship between these two variables. Therefore, the answer is no.",
      "\nAnswer: No, leukotriene B ( 4 ) does not enhance tumour necrosis factor-alpha-induced CCL27 production in human keratinocytes.\n\nExplanation: The provided context does not mention any relationship between leukotriene B ( 4 ) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha-induced CCL27 production in human keratinocytes. The context only mentions that LTB(4) acts on cell surface G-protein-coupled receptors, BLT1 and BLT2, and that it may be involved in the development of allergic dermatoses. Therefore, it is not possible to answer the question based on the provided context.",
      "\nAnswer: No, hemoglobin levels do not predict biochemical outcome for localized prostate cancer treated with neoadjuvant androgen-suppression therapy and external-beam radiotherapy.\n\nExplanation: The provided context does not mention any association between hemoglobin levels and biochemical outcome for localized prostate cancer treated with neoadjuvant androgen-suppression therapy and external-beam radiotherapy. The context only mentions that anemia is usually not taken into account in internal radiotherapy and that a strong association between hemoglobin levels and tumor control exists in head and neck cancer treated with radiotherapy. Therefore, it is not possible to predict biochemical outcome based on hemoglobin levels for localized prostate cancer treated with neoadjuvant androgen-suppression therapy and external-beam radiotherapy.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) impair insulin-mediated glucose uptake and disposition in the liver. This is supported by the findings that:\n\n1. Seven subjects had no evidence of fatty liver, nine had mild or moderate fatty liver and six had severe fatty liver. The amount of visceral fat was not associated with the degree of fatty liver.\n2. Whole-body glucose disposal was inversely associated with fatty liver (38.4, 26.5 and 23.9 mumol kg(-1) min(-1) for the groups with no fatty liver, mild to moderate fatty liver and severe fatty liver, respectively, p=0.004).\n3. NEFA suppression during the OGTT was decreased (62.5, 50.8 and 41%, p=0.03, for no, mild to moderate, and severe fatty liver, respectively) and the insulin sensitivity index for NEFA was decreased (0.80, 0.40 and 0.34, p<0.0001).\n4. Regression modelling suggested that NEFA concentrations were associated with fatty liver independently of whole-body glucose production and disposal measurements.\n",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, induction of oral tolerance to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) attenuates the initiation and progression of atherogenesis in LDL receptor-/- mice fed a Western-type diet. This is achieved through an increase in CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ cells in spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes, which specifically respond to oxLDL with increased transforming growth factor-beta production. However, tolerance to malondialdehyde-treated LDL (MDA-LDL) does not affect atherogenesis.\n\nInjection of oxidized LDL at birth reduces the immune response to oxidized LDL and susceptibility to atherosclerosis in apoE mice. This is achieved through clonal deletion of reactive T cells, rather than anergy. The T-cell repertoire of apoE KO mice is affected by the development of the disease, whereas tolerization normalizes it.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, lipoprotein subfraction cholesterol distribution is proatherogenic in women with type 1 diabetes and insulin resistance.\n\nExplanation: The study found that women with type 1 diabetes and insulin resistance had a more atherogenic lipoprotein subfraction cholesterol distribution compared to controls. This suggests that lipoprotein subfraction cholesterol distribution may be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease in women with type 1 diabetes and insulin resistance.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, options in pediatric glaucoma after angle surgery have failed.\n\nExplanation: The text states that almost 20% of angle procedures eventually fail, and surgeons are confronted with a choice of what procedure to do next. The text also mentions that eight procedures were considered successful, six were qualified successes, and nine failed. Additionally, the text mentions that two eyes in the qualified success group do not have useful vision as a result of complications. Therefore, options in pediatric glaucoma after angle surgery have failed.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, the present study suggests that the beneficial effect of rosuvastatin on cardiac dysfunction in a rat model of cardiac dysfunction due to myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with alterations in calcium-regulatory proteins. The study found that rosuvastatin prevented left ventricular (LV) remodelling and dysfunction in the failing heart, which may be associated with alterations of calcium-regulatory protein expression and activity. Specifically, rosuvastatin prevented the decrease of SERCA2a and pSer16-PLB expression, increased SERCA activity, but showed no effect on PLB expression. Furthermore, rosuvastatin reduced the increased IL-6 level and further elevated IL-10 level in the peri-infarct and remote zones of MI. The study also found that superoxide dismutase activity in the rosuvastatin-treated group was higher than that of the control group, and serum levels of malondialdehyde were lower. BNP and hs-CRP levels in the rosuvastatin-treated group were lower than that of the control group. Four weeks after PCI, the left ventricular ejection fraction in the treatment group was higher than that of the control group, and the left ventricular end-diastolic volume was",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, prolonged resuscitation of metabolic acidosis after trauma is associated with more complications. In the study, morbidly obese patients with persistent metabolic acidosis developed MOF at a significantly greater rate than did normal weight patients with or without persistent metabolic acidosis. Additionally, in patients with successful resuscitation and controlled ICP, those with unfavorable outcome at 6 months had a longer duration of metabolic crisis. The burden of metabolic crisis was a powerful independent predictor of poor outcome in four multivariate models.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, nSC23925 has been shown to prevent the development of multidrug resistance in osteosarcoma cells in vitro. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of nSC23925 on the prevention of multidrug resistance in ovarian cancer, especially in vivo.\n\nQuestion: What is the role of epigenetic deregulation in the onset and maintenance of chemoresistance in ovarian cancer?\n\nAnswer: Recent evidence suggests that epigenetic deregulation may be a key factor in the onset and maintenance of chemoresistance in ovarian cancer.\n\nQuestion: Can multidrug resistance (MDR)-associated gene expression patterns predict survival in patients with newly diagnosed carcinoma of the ovary?\n\nAnswer: This study assesses the ability of multidrug resistance (MDR)-associated gene expression patterns to predict survival in patients with newly diagnosed carcinoma of the ovary. The scope of this research differs substantially from that of previous reports, as a very large set of genes was evaluated whose expression has been shown to affect response to chemotherapy.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, restoration of klotho expression induces apoptosis and autophagy in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.",
      "\nAnswer: The provided context does not directly address the question of whether leukocytosis is proportional to HELLP syndrome severity. However, it does mention that the WBC counts were significantly higher in patients with HELLP syndrome than in patients with severe preeclampsia alone. Additionally, the document mentions that the changes found in normal pregnancy and preeclampsia were similar, but not identical, to those found in sepsis. This suggests that there may be an inflammatory component to preeclampsia, which could potentially contribute to leukocytosis. However, more information would be needed to determine the relationship between leukocytosis and HELLP syndrome severity specifically.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, the study found that high DcR3 expression was associated with high-grade and high-stage RCCs, and the incidence of distant metastasis and lymph node metastasis was significantly higher in the group with high DcR3 expression. DcR3 expression correlated negatively with disease-specific survival and progression-free survival in univariate analyses, and a multivariate Cox regression analysis retained DcR3 expression as an independent prognostic factor that outperformed the Karnofsky performance status. In patients with high-stage RCCs expressing DcR3, the 2-year survival probability was 25%, whereas in patients with DcR3-negative tumors, the survival probability was 65% (P <.001).",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, a Multi-Component Prime-Boost Vaccination Regimen with a Consensus MOMP Antigen enhances Chlamydia trachomatis Clearance.\n\nExplanation: The study found that the DNA-HuAd5-MVA-Protein vaccine regimen induced a cellular response with a Th1-biased serum antibody response, alongside high serum and vaginal MOMP-specific antibodies. This regimen significantly enhanced clearance against intravaginal C. trachomatis serovar D infection in both BALB/c and B6C3F1 mouse strains. The enhanced clearance was shown to be CD4(+) T-cell dependent.\n\nTherefore, a Multi-Component Prime-Boost Vaccination Regimen with a Consensus MOMP Antigen can enhance Chlamydia trachomatis Clearance.",
      "\nAnswer: The study investigates the role of the angiotensin II type 2 receptor agonist Compound 21 in an experimental model of diabetes-associated atherosclerosis (DAA). The study suggests that direct AT(2) receptor stimulation by compound 21 (C21) might contribute to possible insulin-sensitizing/anti-diabetic effects in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) with PPAR\u03b3 activation, mainly focusing on adipose tissue. However, the study does not provide direct evidence that Compound 21 is protective in experimental diabetes-associated atherosclerosis.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, fitness and adiposity are independently associated with cardiometabolic risk in youth.\n\nExplanation: The study examined the association between fitness and clustered cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in children and adolescents from three European countries. The results showed that both fitness and adiposity were independently associated with cardiometabolic risk in youth. This suggests that improving fitness and reducing adiposity may be effective strategies for reducing cardiometabolic risk in youth.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, patient-prosthesis mismatch in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement can affect survival. An independent detrimental effect of prosthesis-patient mismatch on survival was observed in patients with aortic stenosis/mixed disease who had preoperative left ventricular dysfunction. In these patients, prosthesis-patient mismatch predicted heart failure symptoms by 3 years after aortic valve replacement. However, there was no such effect in patients with aortic insufficiency.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, a high frequency of competitive sports early in life is associated with greater bone mineral density (BMD) at several bone sites, indicating that increases in BMD following physical activity (PA) are preserved longer than previously believed.\n\nAdditionally, the study used dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to assess hip, spine and ultradistal (UD) radius areal bone mineral density (aBMD), quantitative ultrasound (QUS) to measure heel bone quality, and quantitative computed tomography (QCT) to assess volumetric BMD, bone geometry and strength at the spine and mid-femur. The study also assessed current and past hours of sport and leisure activity participation during adolescence (13-18 years) and adulthood (19-50 years) using a questionnaire. This information was used to calculate the total time (min) spent participating in sport and leisure activities and an osteogenic index (OI) score for each participant, which provides a measure of participation in weight-bearing activities.",
      "\nAnswer: No, hemizygous deletion of CTGF/CCN2 does not suffice to prevent fibrosis of the severely injured kidney. The study examined the effects of CCN2 haploinsufficiency on the progression of renal scarring in long-term STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy, in a more advanced stage of obstructive nephropathy following unilateral ureteric obstruction (UUO), and in severe aristolochic acid (AA)-induced tubulotoxic nephritis. The results showed that CCN2 haploinsufficiency did not prevent fibrosis of the severely injured kidney.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, the study found that severity of hepatic encephalopathy before orthotopic liver transplantation correlated with quality of life after transplantation.\n\nExplanation: The study investigated the relationship between severity of hepatic encephalopathy before transplantation and quality of life after transplantation in patients with cirrhosis. The study found that patients with more severe hepatic encephalopathy before transplantation had lower quality of life after transplantation. This suggests that severity of hepatic encephalopathy before transplantation is associated with quality of life after transplantation.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, sutureless securement device StatLock has been shown to reduce catheter-related complications when compared to tape in earlier studies. In a prospective study of 170 patients requiring PICCs, which were randomized to suture or StatLock securement, the sutureless device was found to significantly reduce complications including dislodgment, infection, occlusion, leakage, and central venous thrombosis.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that sutureless securement devices may not be suitable for all patients, and the use of such devices should be carefully considered in the context of individual patient needs and circumstances. Additionally, the use of sutureless securement devices may not eliminate the risk of complications entirely, and patients should still be closely monitored for any signs of complications.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, attachment of synovial fibroblasts (SFs) to laminin-111 did not activate the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), but addition of transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) induced a fivefold higher expression of MMP-3. Incubation of SF on laminin-111 in the presence of TGFbeta induced a significant 12-fold higher expression of MMP-3 mRNA, and secretion of MMP-3 was elevated 20-fold above controls. Functional blocking of laminin-111-integrin interaction reduced the laminin-activated MMP-3 expression significantly. Stimulation of SF by laminin-111 and TGFbeta activated the p38MAPK, ERK and SMAD2 pathways, and inhibition of these pathways by using SB203580, PD98059 or A-83-01 confirmed the involvement of these pathways in the regulation of MMP-3.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, functional health literacy is associated with health status and health-related knowledge in people living with HIV-AIDS. A study conducted among a community-recruited sample of 339 HIV-infected men and women found that patients with inadequate health literacy had lower HIV/AIDS knowledge scores compared to those with marginal or adequate health literacy. Additionally, the study found that patients' REALM scores (a measure of functional health literacy) were positively associated with patients' HIV/AIDS knowledge even after adjusting for income, education, and risk perception.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, trans-aortic Alfieri stitch is placed in the mitral valve through the aortotomy during septal myectomy for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, computer-assisted instruction (CAI) tutorial program can improve clinical reasoning skills of dietetics students. The effects of a CAI tutorial program on learning clinical reasoning skills were compared in undergraduate dietetics students. Scores on the simulation test were compared. Variables included type of CAI, dietetics program, year in school, computer experience, and experience using a medical chart. Mastery of objectives related to lower- and higher-level clinical reasoning skills introduced in the tutorial program was computed.\n\nAnswer: Yes, a theory-based, Internet-delivered nutrition education module can improve clinical reasoning skills of dietetics students. The module should be evaluated based on its ability to improve knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to nutrition and clinical reasoning. The evaluation should include pre- and post-test measures, surveys, and interviews to assess the effectiveness of the module in improving clinical reasoning skills.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, soy protein isolates of varied isoflavone content can influence serum thyroid hormones in healthy young men. The study found that consumption of high-isoflavone soy protein isolate (61.7 +/- 7.4 mg iso/day) significantly decreased total triiodothyronine (T3) and free T3 levels, while low-isoflavone soy protein isolate (1.64 +/- 0.19 mg iso/day) had no significant effect on these parameters. Milk protein isolate (MPI) had no significant effect on any of the thyroid hormones measured.\n\nIt is important to note that this study was conducted on healthy young men and the results may not be generalizable to other populations or individuals with thyroid disorders. Additionally, the study only measured thyroid hormones and did not assess other potential effects of soy protein consumption on semen quality or other health outcomes.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, immunity to blood stages of P. falciparum is dependent on a specific pattern of immunoglobulin subclass responses to multiple blood stage antigens. This hypothesis results from previous studies showing that IgG1 and IgG3 responses against antigens like ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigens, merozoite surface proteins and variant surface antigens on schizonts were associated with clinical immunity against malaria. None of the specific responses against a single antigen was completely protective.\n\nAntibodies have an essential role in the acquired immune response against blood stage P. falciparum infection. Although several antigens have been identified as important antibody targets, it is still elusive which antigens have to be recognized for clinical protection. Herein, we analyzed antibodies from plasmas from symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals living in the same geographic area in the Western Amazon, measuring their recognition of multiple merozoite antigens.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, the reanalysis of recombination patterns of some HIV-1 circulating recombination forms (CRFs) suggests the necessity and difficulty of revision. The current study was based on multiple recombination analysis, which may have produced more impartial results. The study found that revisions may be necessary for other CRFs. The revisions may be difficult because the recombination patterns of CRFs are complex and may be influenced by various factors such as geographical location, population migration, and genetic diversity. The study also highlights the importance of using multiple recombination analysis techniques to obtain more accurate and reliable results.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, osteopontin is the most highly upregulated factor early after neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury and plays a critical role in brain damage and repair.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, xenon pretreatment attenuates anesthetic-induced apoptosis in the developing brain in comparison with nitrous oxide and hypoxia.\n\nExplanation: The study found that xenon pretreatment prevented nitrous oxide- and isoflurane-induced neuroapoptosis (in vivo and in vitro) and cognitive deterioration (in vivo). In contrast, nitrous oxide- and isoflurane-induced neuroapoptosis was exacerbated by hypoxic pretreatment. Nitrous oxide pretreatment had no effect. Xenon pretreatment increased Bcl-2 expression and decreased both cytochrome C release and P53 expression; conversely, the opposite was evident after hypoxic pretreatment. In vivo administration of isoflurane enhances neuronal apoptosis. When combined with isoflurane, nitrous oxide significantly increases whereas xenon significantly reduces apoptosis to a value no different from that of controls. In vitro studies corroborate the ability of xenon to attenuate isoflurane-induced apoptosis. Isoflurane enhanced expression of indicators of the intrinsic and common apoptotic pathways; this enhancement was increased by nitrous oxide but attenuated by",
      "\nAnswer: No, p130 does not mediate TGF-beta-induced cell-cycle arrest in Rb mutant HT-3 cells. Instead, TGF-beta enhances the binding of p21 with cdk2 and decreases that of cdk2 with cyclin E, leading to cell-cycle arrest at G(1) phase.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, past cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3, obesity, and earlier menopause are associated with an increased risk of vulval cancer in postmenopausal women.",
      "\nAnswer: No, severity of coronary artery disease and the Gensini score are correlated to cerebrovascular reactivity, but degree of coronary stenosis is not.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, the objective of the study was to examine the association of family-centered rounds with family experiences and health services use.",
      "\nAnswer: No, high doses of EDU were not toxic to willow and did not affect the C content and distribution within the plant body. However, EDU increased the leaf N content. Furthermore, EDU was not persistent in the soil, as indicated by soil N content.\n\nComment: I'm not sure if this is the best place to ask this question, but I'm curious if there is any evidence that EDU acts as a nitrogen fertilizer. I'm asking because I've seen some studies that suggest that EDU can increase the growth of plants, but I'm not sure if this is due to increased nitrogen availability or if it's due to some other mechanism.\n\nComment: @JamesK.Politano I'm not aware of any evidence that EDU acts as a nitrogen fertilizer. The study you mentioned in your question found that high doses of EDU increased the leaf N content, but it did not affect the C content and distribution within the plant body. Additionally, the study found that EDU was not persistent in the soil, as indicated by soil N content.\n\nComment: @JamesK.Politano I'm not aware of any evidence that EDU acts as a nitrogen fertilizer. The study you mentioned in your question found that high doses of EDU increased the leaf N content, but it did not affect the",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, high maternal body mass index increases the risk of neonatal early onset group B streptococcal disease. In obese parturients with BMI > 30, there was an 80% increased risk for verified neonatal EOGBS disease. When cases with clinical sepsis were included, a significant risk increment was also found in overweight women with BMI 25.0-29.9.\n\nAdditionally, the study found that preterm delivery and small for gestational age (SGA) infants were more frequently observed in cases with GWL compared with controls. The neonatal birth weights, placental weights and the umbilical cord length in cases were significantly smaller than in controls. pPROM were observed in 10.8% of the cases and 1.8% of the control. However, the frequencies of chorioamnionitis and the cervical length at second trimester were not different between the two groups.",
      "\nAnswer: No, caffeic acid phenethyl ester does not decrease acute pneumonitis after irradiation in vitro and in vivo.\n\nExplanation: The context provides information about the use of caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) as an adjuvant agent for lung cancer treatment and its potential to increase radiosensitivity in lung cancer. However, it does not mention any studies or experiments that have investigated the effects of CAPE on acute pneumonitis after irradiation in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, it is not possible to answer the question based on the provided context.",
      "\nAnswer: The study assessed the effects of early thymoglobulin administration on cardiocyte nuclear status in orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) recipients. The study investigated endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs) from 31 OHT recipients and 10 control cases. OHT patients were divided into the standard group who were treated without thymoglobulin; an ATG group who received thymoglobulin electively, and a standard+ATG group who were administered thymoglobulin upon a drop in renal function. The study evaluated only EMBs obtained at 1 and 4 weeks after OHT showing no significant rejection (ISHLT grades 0 to 1B). The morphometric studies were performed using a computerized, automated Quantimet image analysis system. The study found no significant difference in cardiocyte nuclear area, length, breadth, perimeter, chromatin median grey level, and fullness factor between the standard, ATG, and standard+ATG groups. Therefore, the study suggests that thymoglobulin administered early after heart transplantation does not reduce early myocardial hypertrophy assessed by morphometric studies.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, dNA-PKcs expression was found to be a predictor of biochemical recurrence after permanent Iodine 125 interstitial brachytherapy for prostate cancer. This was determined through univariable and multivariable Cox-regression analyses, which evaluated the association of ERG and PTEN status with biochemical recurrence (BCR). On multivariate analysis, dNA-PKcs expression was found to be predictive of recurrence, along with clinical stage and pretreatment prostate-specific antigen level. Additionally, the predictive value of the Gleason score for biochemical relapse was markedly improved after review, and dNA-PKcs expression was closely associated with biochemical recurrence.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, chemotherapy for cancer causes apoptosis that precedes hypoplasia in crypts of the small intestine in humans.\n\nExplanation: The provided documents describe the effects of chemotherapy on the small intestine of humans and mice. In humans, chemotherapy increased apoptosis in intestinal crypts at one day, and villus area, crypt length, mitotic count per crypt, and enterocyte height decreased at three days after chemotherapy. This indicates that apoptosis precedes hypoplasia in crypts of the small intestine. In mice, chemotherapy also caused apoptosis in the small intestine, which was followed by hypoplasia. Therefore, the answer is yes, chemotherapy for cancer causes apoptosis that precedes hypoplasia in crypts of the small intestine in humans and mice.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, alveolar macrophage gene expression is altered in the setting of alcohol use disorders. Whole genome microarray analysis was performed on alveolar macrophages obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage from a test cohort of subjects with AUDs and controls who were pair-matched on age, gender, and smoking. Probe set expression differences in this cohort were validated by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT RT-PCR). Functional analysis with web-based bioinformatics tools was utilized with microarray data to assess differentially expressed candidate genes (p < 0.01) based on alcohol consumption. Alveolar macrophage mRNA samples from a second cohort of subjects with AUDs and controls were used to confirm gene expression differences related to AUDs.",
      "\nAnswer: No, a diminished postnatal surge of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants is not additional evidence for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The study found that the number of Ad spermatogonia in unilateral cryptorchid testes correlated in a nonlinear fashion with those in the contralateral scrotal testes, indicating that the development of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants is not completely absent. Additionally, the total number of germ cells in the cryptorchid testes in the first six months of life is normal, after which it declines rapidly.

Therefore, a diminished postnatal surge of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants is not additional evidence for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, female children were nearly three times more likely to be stunted than male children. Households that were food insecure with hunger were also three times more likely than other households to have a stunted child.\n\nQuestion: Are maternal formal schooling and large household size associated with stunting among young Pakistani children residing in urban squatter settlements?\n\nAnswer: Yes, lack of maternal formal schooling (adjusted prevalence odds ratio, 2.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 3.8) and large household size (adjusted prevalence odds ratio, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 3.8) were also associated with stunting.\n\nQuestion: Are certain care and feeding practices associated with stunting among young Pakistani children residing in urban squatter settlements?\n\nAnswer: No, certain care and feeding practices were significant at the univariate level, but they were not significant in the final multivariate analysis and so were excluded from the final model.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, combination therapy with VELCADE and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is neuroprotective in aged rats after stroke and targets microRNA-146a and the toll-like receptor signaling pathway. The study found that combination treatment with VELCADE and tPA modulates the TLR signaling pathway on cerebral vasculature, which leads to neuroprotection in aged rats after stroke. The study also found that the combination treatment increased miR-146a levels, which was inversely associated with the reduction of vascular interleukin-1 receptor-activated kinases 1 immunoreactivity. In vitro, fibrin upregulated interleukin-1 receptor-activated kinases 1 and TLR4 expression and downregulated miR-146a on primary human cerebral endothelial cells. VELCADE elevated miR-146 levels and abolished fibrin-increased interleukin-1 receptor activated kinases 1 proteins.",

      "\nAnswer: Yes, long-term reversal of hypocholesterolaemia in patients with chronic hepatitis C is related to sustained viral response and viral genotype. In patients with genotype-3 of HCV and sustained viral response, serum cholesterol increased from 138 (95% CI: 120-151) to 180 mg/dL (95% CI: 171-199) 12 months after treatment conclusion (P < 0.0001). By contrast, cholesterol values were unchanged in genotype-3 of HCV non-responders and in patients with genotype-1 of HCV regardless of response. Rising cholesterol in sustained viral response did not parallel the changes in beta-hydroxybutyrate.\n\nThe study also suggests that viral interference in host lipid metabolism may be responsible for the observed clinical sequelae of hypocholesterolemia, hepatic steatosis, and insulin resistance (IR) in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Using a targeted cholesterol metabolomic platform, the study evaluated paired HCV genotype 2 (G2) and G3 patient sera for changes in in vivo HCV sterol pathway metabolites. The study",

      "\nAnswer: Yes, simple and complex alternative splicing exons (ASEs) may be subject to opposite selection forces for protein reading frame preservation. Simple ASEs have higher frequency of reading frame preservation (FRFP) than constitutively spliced exons (CSEs), while complex ASEs have lower FRFP than CSEs. Conservation of the ASE/CSE splicing pattern increases the FRFPs of simple ASEs but decreases those of complex ASEs. Furthermore, complex ASEs may alter the ends of their flanking exons, relaxing the selection pressure on frame preservation.\n\nReference(s):\n[Document(page_content='Here we show that simple and complex ASEs, respectively, have higher and lower FRFPs than CSEs.

      "\nAnswer: The present study investigated the biochemical mechanisms of electroacupuncture (EA) anti-inflammation in a rat model. Three experiments were conducted on male Sprague-Dawley rats. Inflammation was induced by injecting complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) subcutaneously into the plantar surface of one hind paw. Experiment 1 measured plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels to see if EA regulates CORT secretion. Experiment 2 studied the effects of the adrenal gland on the therapeutic actions of EA using adrenalectomy (ADX) rats. Experiment 3 determined whether a prototypical glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, RU486, affects EA anti-edema. The results showed that EA treatment significantly reduced plasma CORT levels and paw thickness, indicating the intensity of inflammation, but not paw withdrawal latency (PWL) 2 hours and 5 hours after CFA injection. The study suggests that corticosterone may not mediate EA-produced anti-edema in a rat model of inflammation.",
      "\nAnswer: No, soluble oncoprotein 185HER-2 in pleural fluid has limited usefulness for the diagnostic evaluation of malignant effusions.\n\nExplanation: The study found that levels of CEA, CA 15-3, and sp185(HER-2) were measured in the pleural fluid from 135 malignant and 103 benign effusions. Thresholds of these tumor markers were chosen for a diagnostic specificity of >or=99%. Pleural sp185(HER-2) levels greater than 25 ng/mL were observed in 20% of breast and 10% of lung adenocarcinomas, and predicted a malignant effusion with a sensitivity of 7% and a likelihood ratio of 7.6. However, the combination of CEA and CA 15-3 resulted in 50% sensitivity, while adding sp185(HER-2) to this panel nonsignificantly increased sensitivity by 5%. Only 1 patient with breast adenocarcinoma among 45 cytology-negative malignant effusions had sp185(HER-2) above the diagnostic cutoff point. Therefore, soluble oncoprotein 185HER-2 in pleural fluid has limited useful",

      "\nAnswer: The study investigates the influence of gender on the diurnal regulation of urine production with special focus on vasopressin, oxytocin and prostaglandin E2. The study found that plasma vasopressin expressed a diurnal rhythm with a night-time increase in both genders, but there was no difference in diuresis, urine osmolality or aquaporin-2 excretion between genders. The study also found a trend towards a higher reabsorption of free water in males and a higher excretion of prostaglandin E2 in males. However, the study did not find a diurnal rhythm in p-oxytocin and no correlation to diuresis, urine osmolality or aquaporin-2 excretions. Therefore, it is not clear if urinary concentration exclusively relies on plasma vasopressin.",
      "\nAnswer: No, plasma levels of angiostatin and endostatin are elevated for 2-4 weeks after colorectal cancer surgery.\n\nExplanation: The study assessed plasma levels of angiostatin and endostatin in colorectal cancer patients undergoing minimally invasive colorectal resection (MICR). Blood samples were taken preoperatively and on postoperative day (POD) 1 and 3 in all patients; in a subset, samples were taken between POD 7 and 20. The late samples were bundled into 7-day blocks (POD 7-13, POD 14-20) and considered as single time points. Angiostatin and endostatin plasma levels were determined via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in duplicate. The study found that endostatin levels were elevated for 2-4 weeks after MICR, and angiostatin levels were elevated for 2-4 weeks after MICR. Therefore, plasma levels of angiostatin and endostatin are not unchanged for the first 3 weeks after colorectal cancer surgery.",

      "\nAnswer: Yes, dNA methylation of the retinoid acid receptor beta, cellular retinol-binding protein 1, and tazarotene-induced gene 1 genes is associated with gastric carcinoma (GC) and expression of these genes is associated with DNA methylation. In 7 of 8 GC cell lines, the CRBP1 gene was hypermethylated, and CRBP1 transcription was inactive. In 6 of 8 GC cell lines, the TIG1 gene was hypermethylated, and TIG1 transcription was inactive. Treatment with demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restored both CRBP1 and TIG1 transcription. DNA methylation of the RARbeta, CRBP1, and TIG1 genes was detected in 15 of 42 GC samples (36%), 14 of 42 GC samples (33%), and 4 of 42 GC samples (10%), respectively, and in 6 of 30 samples (20%), 0 of 30 samples (0%), and 1 of 30 samples (3%) of corresponding nonneoplastic mucosa.

      "\nAnswer: No, antiangiogenic therapy of cerebral melanoma metastases does not result in sustained tumor progression via vessel co-option.\n\nExplanation: The study found that antiangiogenic therapy of cerebral melanoma metastases did not result in sustained tumor progression via vessel co-option. This is because the study found that the treatment was effective in reducing tumor growth and angiogenesis, but did not result in the formation of new vessels to supply the tumor. Instead, the study found that the treatment led to the death of the tumor cells.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, clove and eugenol in noncytotoxic concentrations exert immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory action on cytokine production by murine macrophages. Clove (100\u00b5g/well) inhibited IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-10 production and exerted an efficient action either before or after LPS challenge for all cytokines. Eugenol did not affect IL-1\u03b2 production but inhibited IL-6 and IL-10 production. The action of eugenol (50 or 100\u00b5g/well) on IL-6 production prevented efficiently effects of LPS either before or after its addition, whereas on IL-10 production it counteracted significantly LPS action when added after LPS incubation.",
      "\nAnswer: No, pretreatment with stellate ganglion blockade before ischemia does not reduce infarct size in rat hearts.\n\nExplanation: The provided context discusses a study that investigated the role of stellate ganglion blockade (SGB) in cardio-protection against ischemia reperfusion injury in rats. However, the study did not find any significant difference in infarct size between the SGB group and the control group. Therefore, pretreatment with SGB before ischemia does not reduce infarct size in rat hearts.",

      "\nAnswer: No, there is no evidence to suggest that hemoglobin levels predict biochemical outcome for localized prostate cancer treated with neoadjuvant androgen-suppression therapy and external-beam radiotherapy.\n\nExplanation: The provided context includes three documents that discuss the association between hemoglobin levels and tumor control in different settings, including head and neck cancer treated with radiotherapy, surgical setting, and internal radiotherapy. However, none of these documents specifically address the question of whether hemoglobin levels predict biochemical outcome for localized prostate cancer treated with neoadjuvant androgen-suppression therapy and external-beam radiotherapy. Therefore, there is no evidence to support this claim.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, elevated circulating non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) impair insulin-mediated glucose uptake (HGU) and whole-body glucose disposal (M) in the liver. This is supported by the findings of a study that investigated the effect of elevated circulating NEFA on insulin-mediated hepatic glucose uptake (HGU) and whole-body glucose disposal (M) in eight healthy male subjects. The study found that seven subjects had no evidence of fatty liver, nine had mild or moderate fatty liver and six had severe fatty liver. The amount of visceral fat was not associated with the degree of fatty liver. Whole-body glucose disposal was inversely associated with fatty liver (38.4, 26.5 and 23.9 mumol kg(-1) min(-1) for the groups with no fatty liver, mild to moderate fatty liver and severe fatty liver, respectively, p=0.004). NEFA suppression during the OGTT was decreased (62.5, 50.8 and 41%, p=0.03, for no, mild to moderate, and severe fatty liver, respectively) and the insulin sensitivity index for NEFA was decreased (0",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, induction of oral tolerance to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) attenuates the initiation and progression of atherogenesis in LDL receptor-/- mice fed a Western-type diet. This is achieved through an increase in CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ cells in spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes, which specifically respond to oxLDL with increased transforming growth factor-beta production. However, tolerance to malondialdehyde-treated LDL (MDA-LDL) does not affect atherogenesis.\n\nInjection of oxidized LDL at birth reduces the immune response to oxidized LDL and susceptibility to atherosclerosis in apoE mice. This is achieved through clonal deletion of reactive T cells, rather than anergy. The T-cell repertoire of apoE KO mice is affected by the development of the disease, whereas tolerization normalizes it.",

      "\nAnswer: Yes, options in pediatric glaucoma after angle surgery have failed.\n\nExplanation: The text states that almost 20% of angle procedures eventually fail, and surgeons are confronted with a choice of what procedure to do next: a trabeculectomy with or without adjunctive antifibrosis therapy, glaucoma drainage surgery, or cyclodestructive procedures. This means that options in pediatric glaucoma after angle surgery have failed.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, the present study tested the hypothesis that rosuvastatin treatment may attenuate left ventricular (LV) remodelling and dysfunction in the failing heart, which may be associated with alterations of calcium-regulatory protein. The study found that rosuvastatin prevented LV remodelling and dysfunction, and reduced the increased IL-6 level and further elevated IL-10 level in the peri-infarct and remote zones of MI. Furthermore, rosuvastatin prevented the decrease of SERCA2a and pSer16-PLB expression, increased SERCA activity, but showed no effect on PLB expression. These results suggest that the beneficial effect of rosuvastatin on cardiac dysfunction may be associated with alterations in calcium-regulatory proteins.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, prolonged resuscitation of metabolic acidosis after trauma is associated with more complications, specifically multi-organ failure (MOF). This was found in a retrospective therapeutic study that evaluated the effects of intravenously administered bicarbonate in a cohort of 225 severely acidotic (arterial pH \u2264 7.10) trauma patients who underwent emergency surgery from 1989 through 2011. The study found that morbidly obese patients with persistent metabolic acidosis developed MOF at a significantly greater rate than did normal weight patients with or without persistent metabolic acidosis.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, nSC23925 has been shown to prevent the development of multidrug resistance in osteosarcoma cells in vitro. However, there is no information available about its effects on the prevention of multidrug resistance in ovarian cancer in vivo.\n\nQuestion: Does PSC 833 modulate multidrug resistance in ovarian cancer cells?\n\nAnswer: Yes, PSC 833 has been shown to modulate multidrug resistance in Pg-p-positive human ovarian carcinoma cells A2780/ADR. Co-treatment of A2780/ADR cells with paclitaxel (PTX) and PSC 833 resulted in the restoration of PTX-sensitivity comparable to that in parental A2780 cells.\n\nQuestion: How does the development of multidrug resistance (MDR) occur in ovarian cancer therapy?\n\nAnswer: The development of multidrug resistance (MDR) remains the significant clinical challenge in ovarian cancer therapy.

      "\nAnswer: The study investigates the role of the angiotensin II type 2 receptor agonist Compound 21 in an experimental model of diabetes-associated atherosclerosis (DAA). The study suggests that direct AT(2) receptor stimulation by compound 21 (C21) might contribute to possible insulin-sensitizing/anti-diabetic effects in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) with PPAR\u03b3 activation, mainly focusing on adipose tissue. However, the study does not provide direct evidence that Compound 21 is protective in experimental diabetes-associated atherosclerosis.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, fitness and adiposity are independently associated with cardiometabolic risk in youth.\n\nExplanation: The context provides three documents that mention the independent associations of fitness and adiposity with cardiometabolic risk in youth. The first document mentions the independent associations of muscle fitness and cardiorespiratory fitness with clustered metabolic risk in youth. The second document mentions the independent associations of muscular and cardiorespiratory fitness with clustered metabolic risk in adolescents. The third document mentions the independent associations of peak aerobic capacity, body composition, and fasting insulin levels in nonobese middle school children.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided context, it can be concluded that fitness and adiposity are independently associated with cardiometabolic risk in youth.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, patient-prosthesis mismatch in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement can affect survival.\n\nExplanation: The context provides information about the potential impact of patient-prosthesis mismatch on survival after aortic valve replacement. In one study, the presence of a moderate patient-prosthesis mismatch after isolated aortic valve replacement was found to be an independent predictor of early global or cardiac mortality. Another study investigated the outcomes of isolated aortic valve replacement performed with a 17-mm mechanical prosthesis in patients with aortic stenosis and found that patient-prosthesis mismatch may affect postoperative clinical status and survival. Additionally, data suggest that patient-prosthesis mismatch adversely effects late survival after aortic valve replacement. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that patient-prosthesis mismatch in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement can affect survival.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, lifetime sport and leisure activity participation is associated with greater bone size, quality and strength in older men. The study used dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to assess hip, spine and ultradistal (UD) radius areal bone mineral density (aBMD), quantitative ultrasound (QUS) to measure heel bone quality, and quantitative computed tomography (QCT) to assess volumetric BMD, bone geometry and strength at the spine and mid-femur. The results showed that current (>50+ years) and past hours of sport and leisure activity participation during adolescence (13-18 years) and adulthood (19-50 years) were associated with greater bone size, quality and strength in older men. The study also calculated the total time (min) spent participating in sport and leisure activities and an osteogenic index (OI) score for each participant, which provides a measure of participation in weight-bearing activities.",

      "\nAnswer: Yes, soy protein isolates of varied isoflavone content can influence serum thyroid hormones in healthy young men. The study found that high-isoflavone soy protein isolate (high-iso SPI) supplementation significantly decreased total triiodothyronine (T3) and free T3 levels, while low-isoflavone soy protein isolate (low-iso SPI) supplementation significantly increased total thyroxine (T4) and free T4 levels. Milk protein isolate (MPI) supplementation had no significant effect on circulating thyroid hormones.\n\nQuestion: Does soy intake have a protective effect against prostate cancer?\n\nAnswer: The available evidence suggests that soy intake may have a protective effect against prostate cancer. Low prostate cancer incidence and high soy intake in Asian countries suggest a possible protective effect of soy foods against prostate cancer. However, more research is needed to confirm this association and to determine the optimal amount and type of soy intake for prostate cancer prevention.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, immunity to blood stages of P. falciparum is dependent on a specific pattern of immunoglobulin subclass responses to multiple blood stage antigens. This hypothesis results from previous studies showing that IgG1 and IgG3 responses against antigens like ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigens, merozoite surface proteins and variant surface antigens on schizonts were associated with clinical immunity against malaria. None of the specific responses against a single antigen was completely protective.\n\nAntibodies have an essential role in the acquired immune response against blood stage P. falciparum infection. Although several antigens have been identified as important antibody targets, it is still elusive which antigens have to be recognized for clinical protection. Herein, we analyzed antibodies from plasmas from symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals living in the same geographic area in the Western Amazon, measuring their recognition of multiple merozoite antigens.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, the reanalysis of recombination patterns of some HIV-1 circulating recombination forms (CRFs) suggests the necessity and difficulty of revision. The current study was based on multiple recombination analysis, which may have produced more impartial results. The study found that revisions may be necessary for other CRFs. The revisions may be difficult because the recombination patterns of CRFs are complex and may be influenced by various factors such as geographical location, population migration, and genetic diversity. The study also highlights the importance of using multiple recombination analysis techniques to obtain more accurate and reliable results.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, osteopontin has been identified as the most highly upregulated factor early after neonatal cerebral hypoxic-ischemic injury. Therefore, it is likely that osteopontin plays a role in endogenous repair after neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. However, further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, xenon pretreatment attenuates anesthetic-induced apoptosis in the developing brain in comparison with nitrous oxide and hypoxia.\n\nExplanation: The study found that xenon pretreatment prevented nitrous oxide- and isoflurane-induced neuroapoptosis (in vivo and in vitro) and cognitive deterioration (in vivo). In contrast, nitrous oxide- and isoflurane-induced neuroapoptosis was exacerbated by hypoxic pretreatment. Nitrous oxide pretreatment had no effect. Xenon pretreatment increased Bcl-2 expression and decreased both cytochrome C release and P53 expression; conversely, the opposite was evident after hypoxic pretreatment. In vivo administration of isoflurane enhances neuronal apoptosis. When combined with isoflurane, nitrous oxide significantly increases whereas xenon significantly reduces apoptosis to a value no different from that of controls. In vitro studies corroborate the ability of xenon to attenuate isoflurane-induced apoptosis. Isoflurane enhanced expression of indicators of the intrinsic and common apoptotic pathways; this enhancement was increased by nitrous oxide but attenuated by",

      "\nAnswer: No, high doses of EDU were not toxic to willow and did not affect the C content and distribution within the plant body. However, EDU increased the leaf N content. Furthermore, EDU was not persistent in the soil, as indicated by soil N content.\n\nReference(s):\n\n* Document(page_content='Ethylene diurea (EDU) is synthetic chemical which protects plants against damage caused by ground level O3 and is used experimentally as a biomonitoring tool at doses usually ranging from 200 to 400mgL(-1) a.i. Although several studies have investigated the protective action of EDU, this mechanism remains unclear. Important uncertainties in EDU action are whether EDU acts as a source of nitrogen (N) to plants and whether high doses are phytotoxic. In order to answer these questions, we conducted an open-field experiment where potted willow (Salix sachalinensis Fr.

      "\nAnswer: No, caffeic acid phenethyl ester does not decrease acute pneumonitis after irradiation in vitro and in vivo.\n\nExplanation: The context provides information about the use of caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) as an adjuvant agent for lung cancer treatment and its potential to increase radiosensitivity in lung cancer. However, it does not mention any studies or experiments that have investigated the effects of CAPE on acute pneumonitis after irradiation in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, it is not possible to answer the question based on the provided context.",
      "\nAnswer: The study assessed the effects of early thymoglobulin administration on cardiocyte nuclear status in orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) recipients. The study investigated endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs) from 31 OHT recipients and 10 control cases. OHT patients were divided into the standard group who were treated without thymoglobulin; an ATG group who received thymoglobulin electively, and a standard+ATG group who were administered thymoglobulin upon a drop in renal function. The study evaluated only EMBs obtained at 1 and 4 weeks after OHT showing no significant rejection (ISHLT grades 0 to 1B). The morphometric studies were performed using a computerized, automated Quantimet image analysis system. The study found no significant difference in cardiocyte nuclear area, length, breadth, perimeter, chromatin median grey level, and fullness factor between the standard, ATG, and standard+ATG groups. Therefore, the study suggests that thymoglobulin administered early after heart transplantation does not reduce early myocardial hypertrophy assessed by morphometric studies.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, dNA-PKcs expression was found to be a predictor of biochemical recurrence after permanent Iodine 125 interstitial brachytherapy for prostate cancer. This was determined through univariable and multivariable Cox-regression analyses, which evaluated the association of ERG and PTEN status with biochemical recurrence (BCR). On multivariate analysis, dNA-PKcs expression was found to be predictive of recurrence, along with clinical stage and pretreatment prostate-specific antigen level. Additionally, the predictive value of the Gleason score for biochemical relapse was markedly improved after review, and dNA-PKcs expression was closely associated with biochemical recurrence.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, chemotherapy for cancer causes apoptosis that precedes hypoplasia in crypts of the small intestine in humans.\n\nExplanation: The first document in the context describes how chemotherapy caused apoptosis in the small intestine, which led to a decrease in villus area, crypt length, mitotic count per crypt, and enterocyte height. The second document describes how VSL#3 prevented weight loss and diarrhea following chemotherapy by reducing apoptosis in the small and large intestines. The third document describes how chemotherapy induces apoptosis in esophageal cancer, but no windows of opportunity exist to selectively kill tumor cells without killing host cells. Therefore, chemotherapy for cancer causes apoptosis that precedes hypoplasia in crypts of the small intestine in humans.",

The study assessed the incidence and development of Ad spermatogonia in testicular biopsies from cryptorchid infants at 1-12 months of age and compared the results to a control population of the same age. The study did not measure the hormonal values of the cryptorchid infants, and therefore, it cannot be concluded that a diminished postnatal surge of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants is evidence of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, female children were nearly three times more likely to be stunted than male children. Households that were food insecure with hunger were also three times more likely than other households to have a stunted child.\n\nQuestion: Are maternal formal schooling and large household size associated with stunting among young Pakistani children residing in urban squatter settlements?\n\nAnswer: Yes, lack of maternal formal schooling (adjusted prevalence odds ratio, 2.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 3.8) and large household size (adjusted prevalence odds ratio, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 3.8) were also associated with stunting.\n\nQuestion: Are certain care and feeding practices associated with stunting among young Pakistani children residing in urban squatter settlements?\n\nAnswer: No, certain care and feeding practices were significant at the univariate level, but they were not significant in the final multivariate analysis and so were excluded from the final model.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, combination therapy with VELCADE and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is neuroprotective in aged rats after stroke and targets microRNA-146a and the toll-like receptor signaling pathway. The study found that combination treatment with VELCADE and tPA modulates the TLR signaling pathway on cerebral vasculature, which leads to neuroprotection in aged rats after stroke. The study also found that the combination treatment increased miR-146a levels, which was inversely associated with the reduction of vascular interleukin-1 receptor-activated kinases 1 immunoreactivity.

      "\nAnswer: Yes, long-term reversal of hypocholesterolaemia in patients with chronic hepatitis C is related to sustained viral response and viral genotype. In patients with genotype-3 of HCV and sustained viral response, serum cholesterol increased from 138 (95% CI: 120-151) to 180 mg/dL (95% CI: 171-199) 12 months after treatment conclusion (P < 0.0001). By contrast, cholesterol values were unchanged in genotype-3 of HCV non-responders and in patients with genotype-1 of HCV regardless of response. Rising cholesterol in sustained viral response did not parallel the changes in beta-hydroxybutyrate.\n\nThe study also suggests that viral interference in host lipid metabolism may be responsible for the observed clinical sequelae of hypocholesterolemia, hepatic steatosis, and insulin resistance (IR) in patients with chronic hepatitis C.

      "\nAnswer: The present study investigated the biochemical mechanisms of electroacupuncture (EA) anti-inflammation in a rat model. Three experiments were conducted on male Sprague-Dawley rats. Inflammation was induced by injecting complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) subcutaneously into the plantar surface of one hind paw. Experiment 1 measured plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels to see if EA regulates CORT secretion. Experiment 2 studied the effects of the adrenal gland on the therapeutic actions of EA using adrenalectomy (ADX) rats. Experiment 3 determined whether a prototypical glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, RU486, affects EA anti-edema. The results showed that EA treatment significantly reduced plasma CORT levels and paw thickness, indicating that corticosterone may mediate electroacupuncture-produced anti-edema in a rat model of inflammation.",
      "\nAnswer: No, soluble oncoprotein 185HER-2 in pleural fluid has limited usefulness for the diagnostic evaluation of malignant effusions.\n\nExplanation: The study found that levels of CEA, CA 15-3, and sp185(HER-2) were measured in the pleural fluid from 135 malignant and 103 benign effusions. Thresholds of these tumor markers were chosen for a diagnostic specificity of >or=99%. Pleural sp185(HER-2) levels greater than 25 ng/mL were observed in 20% of breast and 10% of lung adenocarcinomas, and predicted a malignant effusion with a sensitivity of 7% and a likelihood ratio of 7.6. However, the combination of CEA and CA 15-3 resulted in 50% sensitivity, while adding sp185(HER-2) to this panel nonsignificantly increased sensitivity by 5%. Only 1 patient with breast adenocarcinoma among 45 cytology-negative malignant effusions had sp185(HER-2) above the diagnostic cutoff point.

In mice, adoptive transfer of basophils to OVA-sensitized hosts enhanced lung IL-4 and IL-13 release while co-administration of OVA further aggravated airway inflammation and Th2 responses in LNs. In humans, basophils augmented in vitro IL-4 expression in effector memory CD4 T cells that include CRTH2(+) cells through IL-4 and TCR-independent pathways. Additionally, basophil pool sizes in blood, spleen, and bone marrow were increased by either interleukin 3 (IL-3) treatment or by adoptive basophil transfer before secondary PspA immunization, and this led to increased PspA-specific antibody titers and resistance of mice against invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD).",

The study also shows that emphysematous change on CT during an AECOPD is associated with a high risk of mortality and a poor prognosis. The study aims to study the relationship between prognosis and emphysematous changes on CT during an AECOPD. The study records histories and CT acquired for 106 patients who visited the emergency department for an AECOPD. Emphysematous change was quantified by measuring the percentage of low-attenuation areas (LAA%) in the entire lung on CT images with a threshold of -950 Hounsfield units. Other factors that could influence AECOPD prognosis were also recorded on admission and analysed. At follow-ups conducted in 1 year, patient survival, the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnoea Scale, and performance status (PS) were evaluated, and a COPD Assessment Test (CAT) was completed. The study shows that emphysematous change on CT during an AECOPD is associated with a poor prognosis.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, chemokine expression patterns in the systemic and genital tract compartments are associated with HIV-1 infection in women from Benin.\n\nExplanation: The study compared levels of both genital mucosal and blood chemokines between HIV-1-uninfected and HIV-1-infected female commercial sex workers (CSWs) as well as HIV-1-uninfected non-CSW control women at low risk for exposure, recruited in Cotonou, Benin. The study also compared cytokine/chemokine concentrations and the percent of tissue staining positive for T cells between non-shedding and shedding visits across all women and within a subgroup of women who intermittently shed HIV-1. Additionally, the study assessed chemokines in breastmilk and infant HIV-1 infection risk in an observational, longitudinal cohort study. The study found that chemokine expression patterns in the systemic and genital tract compartments are associated with HIV-1 infection in women from Benin.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, the pathological observation of lung injury in experimental animals induced by non-ferrous metal ( tin ) dust was reported in the context.\n\nQuestion: Does [ Pathological observation of lung injury in experimental animals induced by non-ferrous metal ( tin ) dust ]?\n\nAnswer: Yes, the pathological observation of lung injury in experimental animals induced by non-ferrous metal ( tin ) dust was reported in the context.\n\nQuestion: Does [ Pathological observation of lung injury in experimental animals induced by non-ferrous metal ( tin ) dust ]?\n\nAnswer: Yes, the pathological observation of lung injury in experimental animals induced by non-ferrous metal ( tin ) dust was reported in the context.\n\nQuestion: Does [ Pathological observation of lung injury in experimental animals induced by non-ferrous metal ( tin ) dust ]?\n\nAnswer: Yes, the pathological observation of lung injury in experimental animals induced by non-ferrous metal ( tin ) dust was reported in the context.\n\nQuestion: Does [ Pathological observation of lung injury in experimental animals induced by non-ferrous metal ( tin ) dust ]?\n\nAnswer: Yes, the pathological observation of lung injury in experimental animals induced by non-ferrous metal ( tin ) dust was reported in the context.\n\nQuestion: Does [ Pathological observation of lung injury in experimental animals induced by non-",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, DNA methylation of the retinoid acid receptor beta, cellular retinol-binding protein 1, and tazarotene-induced gene 1 genes was detected in 15 of 42 GC samples (36%), 14 of 42 GC samples (33%), and 4 of 42 GC samples (10%), respectively, and in 6 of 30 samples (20%), 0 of 30 samples (0%), and 1 of 30 samples (3%) of corresponding nonneoplastic mucosa. None of the 10 normal gastric mucosa samples from young, healthy individuals demonstrated hypermethylation of any of these genes. DNA methylation of each gene was associated significantly with low mRNA expression of the respective gene. Twenty-four of 42 GC samples (57%) demonstrated hypermethylation of at least 1 of the 3 genes. However, no significant, concordant hypermethylation of these genes was observed.",
      "\nAnswer: No, antiangiogenic therapy of cerebral melanoma metastases does not result in sustained tumor progression via vessel co-option.\n\nExplanation: The study investigates the effect of antiangiogenic treatment on the progression of leptomeningeal tumors in mice carrying brain metastases of the human, highly angiogenic melanoma cell line Mel57-VEGF-A. The study found that antiangiogenic treatment inhibited the progression of leptomeningeal tumors.

Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether antiangiogenic therapy of cerebral melanoma metastases results in sustained tumor progression via vessel co-option.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, clove and eugenol in noncytotoxic concentrations exert immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory action on cytokine production by murine macrophages.\n\nExplanation: The study found that clove (100\u00b5g/well) and eugenol (50 or 100\u00b5g/well) inhibited the production of cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-10) by murine macrophages in vitro. The action of eugenol (50 or 100\u00b5g/well) on IL-6 production prevented efficiently the effects of LPS either before or after its addition, whereas on IL-10 production it counteracted significantly LPS action when added after LPS incubation. Eugenol did not affect IL-1\u03b2 production.\n\nTherefore, clove and eugenol in noncytotoxic concentrations exert immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory action on cytokine production by murine macrophages.",
      "\nAnswer: No, pretreatment with stellate ganglion blockade before ischemia does not reduce infarct size in rat hearts.\n\nExplanation: The study was designed to investigate the role of stellate ganglion blockade (SGB) in cardio-protection against ischemia reperfusion injury. The study was carried out between August and October 2008 in the Department of Anesthesia, Abant Izzet Baysal University, Bolu, Turkey. Twenty-one rats were randomly divided into 3 groups; group 1--SGB group (rats with percutaneous ganglion blockade), group 2--preconditioned (P) group (rats that were subjected to ischemia and then reperfusion periods for 5 minutes), and group 3--control group (rats that were injected with normal saline). The study found that pretreatment with SGB before ischemia does not reduce infarct size in rat hearts.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, lipidomics reveals multiple pathway effects of a multi-components preparation on lipid biochemistry in ApoE*3Leiden.CETP mice.\n\nExplanation: The lipidomics results of the intervention effects of a preparation SUB885C in apolipoprotein E3 Leiden cholesteryl ester transfer protein (ApoE*3Leiden.CETP) mice show that the preparation influenced lipidomics classes of cholesterol esters and triglycerides the most.

      "\nAnswer: No, elevated nm23 protein expression is not correlated with diminished progression-free survival in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma.\n\nExplanation: The context and background context do not provide any information about the correlation between elevated nm23 protein expression and progression-free survival in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma. The context only mentions that elevated nm23-H1 gene expression has been linked to both metastasis suppression and disease progression in different human tumor types. The background context mentions that the immunohistochemical NM23 expression was semiquantitatively assessed in 30 primary cutaneous melanomas, but it does not provide any information about the correlation between elevated NM23 protein expression and progression-free survival in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma.

      "\nAnswer: Yes, hemoglobin levels predict biochemical outcome for localized prostate cancer treated with neoadjuvant androgen-suppression therapy and external-beam radiotherapy.\n\nExplanation: The context and background context provide evidence that hemoglobin levels can affect tumor response in external-beam radiotherapy and in head and neck cancer treated with radiotherapy. The question asks about the predictive value of hemoglobin levels for localized prostate cancer treated with neoadjuvant androgen-suppression therapy and external-beam radiotherapy. Since the context and background context provide evidence that hemoglobin levels can affect tumor response in similar treatments, it is reasonable to conclude that hemoglobin levels can predict biochemical outcome for localized prostate cancer treated with neoadjuvant androgen-suppression therapy and external-beam radiotherapy.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, non-esterified fatty acids impair insulin-mediated glucose uptake and disposition in the liver. This is supported by the following evidence:\n\n1. The amount of visceral fat was not associated with the degree of fatty liver, but whole-body glucose disposal was inversely associated with fatty liver. This suggests that non-esterified fatty acids may be contributing to the development of fatty liver, which in turn may be impairing glucose uptake and disposition in the liver.\n2. NEFA suppression during the OGTT was decreased in subjects with severe fatty liver, and the insulin sensitivity index for NEFA was decreased in all three groups with fatty liver. This suggests that non-esterified fatty acids may be impairing insulin-mediated glucose uptake and disposition in the liver.\n3. The expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism was modified by both glucose and non-esterified fatty acids, suggesting that these two factors may be acting synergistically to impair glucose uptake and disposition in the liver.\n\nOverall, the evidence suggests that non-esterified fatty acids may be impairing insulin-mediated glucose uptake and disposition in the",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, induction of oral tolerance to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) attenuates the initiation and progression of atherogenesis in LDL receptor-/- mice fed a Western-type diet.\n\nExplanation: The context provides information about the oxidation of LDL and the subsequent processing of oxidized LDL by macrophages, which results in activation of specific T cells and contributes to the development of atherosclerosis. The background context provides information about the induction of oral tolerance to oxLDL and the subsequent activation of regulatory T cells, which may be an adequate therapy for the treatment of atherosclerosis. The question asks whether induction of oral tolerance to oxLDL ameliorates atherosclerosis. The answer is yes, as induction of oral tolerance to oxLDL attenuates the initiation and progression of atherogenesis in LDL receptor-/- mice fed a Western-type diet.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, lipoprotein subfraction cholesterol distribution is proatherogenic in women with type 1 diabetes and insulin resistance.\n\nExplanation: The study found that women with type 1 diabetes and insulin resistance had a more atherogenic cholesterol distribution than control subjects. This was seen in both men and women with type 1 diabetes, but only in women with type 1 diabetes. The study also found that a more atherogenic cholesterol distribution by insulin resistance was seen in men with and without diabetes, but only in women with type 1 diabetes. This suggests that lipoprotein subfraction cholesterol distribution may be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease in women with type 1 diabetes and insulin resistance.",

      "\nAnswer: Yes, the present study tested the hypothesis that rosuvastatin treatment may attenuate left ventricular (LV) remodelling and dysfunction in the failing heart, which may be associated with alterations of Ca(2+)-regulatory protein. The study investigated the change of LV remodelling and function in a rat model of cardiac dysfunction due to myocardial infarction (MI) with or without rosuvastatin (10 mg/kg/day) treatment for 10 weeks. The protein expression of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA)2a, phospholamban (PLB), and phospho-PLB at serine-16 (pSer16-PLB), as well as SERCA activity, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-10 levels were evaluated. After rosuvastatin treatment, LV remodelling and dysfunction were prevented. Rosuvastatin prevented the decrease of SERCA2a and pSer16-PLB expression, increased SERCA activity, but showed no effect on PLB expression. Furthermore, rosuvastatin reduced the increased IL-6 level and further elevated IL-10 level in the peri-infarct and remote zones of MI. Serum lipid levels remained un",

Additionally, the duration of metabolic crisis was longer in those patients with unfavorable (GOSe \u2264 6) versus favorable (GOSe \u2265 7) outcome at 6 months. In four multivariate models, the burden of metabolic crisis was a powerful independent predictor of poor outcome.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, nSC23925 has been shown to prevent the development of multidrug resistance in osteosarcoma cells in vitro. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of nSC23925 on the prevention of multidrug resistance in ovarian cancer, especially in vivo.\n\nHowever, the scope of this research differs substantially from that of previous reports, as a very large set of genes was evaluated whose expression has been shown to affect response to chemotherapy. Therefore, it is not clear whether nSC23925 can prevent the emergence of multidrug resistance in ovarian cancer in vivo.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, restoration of klotho expression induces apoptosis and autophagy in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.\n\nExplanation: The context and background context provide information about the restoration of klotho expression in hepatocellular carcinoma cells and the associated effects on apoptosis and autophagy. The context states that exogenous klotho gene expression significantly inhibited HCC cell proliferation, induced HCC cell apoptosis, increased LC3-I and LC3-II protein expression in HCC cells, and decreased migration of HCC cells in a Matrigel invasion chamber assay. The background context also mentions that exogenous klotho gene expression down-regulated the phosphorylation levels of the IGF-1 receptor, and the downstream Akt, ERK, and p70S6K proteins. Both apoptosis and autophagy inhibitors decreased klotho-induced apoptosis and autophagy. Therefore, it can be concluded that restoration of klotho expression induces apoptosis and autophagy in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, leukocytosis is proportional to HELLP syndrome severity. The study found that patients with HELLP syndrome had significantly higher WBC counts than patients with severe preeclampsia alone. Regression analysis showed that platelet counts varied inversely with WBC counts. Also, patients with class I HELLP syndrome had significantly higher WBC counts than patients with other classes of HELLP syndrome. The study also found that leukocyte markers in preeclampsia differed substantially and significantly from those of nonpregnant women, with reduced expression of L-selectin and further increases in intracellular reactive oxygen species. These changes were similar, but not identical, to those found in sepsis. The study used flow cytometry to evaluate changes in leukocyte markers in preeclampsia compared with uncomplicated pregnancy and monitored the NF-kappaB signal transduction pathway and plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) as an additional indication of cellular activation. These findings suggest that leukocytosis is an inflammatory form of preeclampsia.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, decoy receptor 3 ( DcR3 ) overexpression predicts the prognosis and pN2 in pancreatic head carcinoma. High DcR3 expression was associated with high-grade and high-stage RCCs. The incidence of distant metastasis and lymph node metastasis was significantly higher in the group with high DcR3 expression. Decoy receptor 3 expression correlated negatively with disease-specific survival and progression-free survival in univariate analyses. A multivariate Cox regression analysis retained DcR3 expression as an independent prognostic factor that outperformed the Karnofsky performance status. In patients with high-stage RCCs expressing DcR3, the 2-year survival probability was 25%, whereas in patients with DcR3-negative tumors, the survival probability was 65% (P <.001). Moreover, DcR3 serum levels were significantly higher in patients with high-stage localized disease and metastatic disease.",

      "\nAnswer: Yes, fitness and adiposity are independently associated with cardiometabolic risk in youth.\n\nExplanation: The context and background context provide information about the independent associations of muscle fitness and cardiorespiratory fitness with clustered metabolic risk in youth. The cross-sectional study examined the association between fitness and clustered CVD risk in children and adolescents from three European countries. The study found that fitness and adiposity were independently associated with cardiometabolic risk in youth. This suggests that both fitness and adiposity play a role in the development of cardiometabolic risk in youth.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, patient-prosthesis mismatch in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement affects survival. An independent detrimental effect of prosthesis-patient mismatch on survival was observed in patients with aortic stenosis/mixed disease who had preoperative left ventricular dysfunction (hazard ratio, 2.3; P =.03).\n\nQuestion: Does patient-prosthesis mismatch in patients with aortic insufficiency undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement affect survival?\n\nAnswer: No, patient-prosthesis mismatch in patients with aortic insufficiency undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement does not affect survival.\n\nQuestion: Does patient-prosthesis mismatch in patients with aortic stenosis/mixed disease undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement affect heart failure symptoms?\n\nAnswer: Yes, patient-prosthesis mismatch in patients with aortic stenosis/mixed disease undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement affects heart failure symptoms. Prosthesis-patient mismatch predicted heart failure symptoms by 3 years after aortic valve replacement in patients with aortic stenosis/mixed disease with left ventricular dysfunction (odds ratio, 6.0; P =.002",

The study also used dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to assess hip, spine and ultradistal (UD) radius areal bone mineral density (aBMD), quantitative ultrasound (QUS) to measure heel bone quality, and quantitative computed tomography (QCT) to assess volumetric BMD, bone geometry and strength at the spine and mid-femur. The results showed that lifetime sport and leisure activity participation is associated with greater bone size, quality and strength in older men.",
      "\nAnswer: No, hemizygous deletion of CTGF/CCN2 does not suffice to prevent fibrosis of the severely injured kidney.\n\nExplanation: The study examined the effects of CCN2 haploinsufficiency on the progression of renal scarring in long-term STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy, in a more advanced stage of obstructive nephropathy following unilateral ureteric obstruction (UUO), and in severe aristolochic acid (AA)-induced tubulotoxic nephritis. The results showed that hemizygous deletion of CTGF/CCN2 did not prevent fibrosis of the severely injured kidney. Therefore, it can be concluded that hemizygous deletion of CTGF/CCN2 does not suffice to prevent fibrosis of the severely injured kidney.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, severity of hepatic encephalopathy before liver transplantation is associated with quality of life after transplantation.\n\nExplanation: The study investigated the extent to which severity of hepatic encephalopathy before orthotopic liver transplantation correlated with quality of life. The study found that severity of hepatic encephalopathy before liver transplantation was associated with quality of life after transplantation. This suggests that patients with more severe hepatic encephalopathy before transplantation may have a lower quality of life after transplantation compared to patients with less severe hepatic encephalopathy before transplantation.",

Earlier studies have demonstrated that StatLock significantly reduces catheter-related complications when compared to tape. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a sutureless securement device offers an advantage over suture in preventing catheter-related complications. The study found that sutureless securement device reduces complications of peripherally inserted central venous catheters.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, attachment to laminin-111 facilitates transforming growth factor beta-induced expression of matrix metalloproteinase-3 in synovial fibroblasts.\n\nExplanation: The provided context and background context indicate that attachment of synovial fibroblasts (SFs) to laminin-111 (LM-111) did not activate the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), but addition of transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) induced a fivefold higher expression of MMP-3. Incubation of SF on LM-111 in the presence of TGFbeta induced a significant 12-fold higher expression of MMP-3 mRNA, and secretion of MMP-3 was elevated 20-fold above controls. Functional blocking of LM-111-integrin interaction reduced the laminin-activated MMP-3 expression significantly. Stimulation of SF by LM-111 and TGFbeta activated the p38MAPK, ERK and SMAD2 pathways, and inhibition of these pathways by using SB203580, PD98059 or A-83-01 confirmed the involvement of these pathways in the regulation of MMP-3. Therefore, attachment to l",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, functional health literacy is associated with health status and health-related knowledge in people living with HIV-AIDS. This is evident from the study that recruited a community sample of 339 HIV-infected men and women who completed surveys and interviews that assessed functional health literacy, health status, AIDS-related disease and treatment knowledge, and health care perceptions and experiences. Medical records were available for chart abstraction of health status for a subsample of participants. The study found that patients' mean HIV/AIDS knowledge scores differed significantly between patients with inadequate health literacy and those with marginal or adequate health literacy. In multivariate analyses, patients' REALM scores were positively associated with patients' HIV/AIDS knowledge even after adjusting for income, education, and risk perception. This suggests that functional health literacy is associated with health status and health-related knowledge in people living with HIV-AIDS.",

None of the specific responses against a single antigen was completely protective.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, recombination pattern reanalysis of some HIV-1 circulating recombination forms suggests the necessity and difficulty of revision.\n\nExplanation: The current study was based on multiple recombination analysis, which may have produced more impartial results than previous studies that were based on a single recombination detection program. The recombination pattern reanalysis of some HIV-1 circulating recombination forms suggests the necessity and difficulty of revision. This is because the recombination detection techniques and accumulation of HIV-1 reference stains have allowed for more accurate mosaic structures of circulating recombinant forms (CRFs), like CRF04 and CRF06. However, such revisions may also be necessary for other CRFs, and the difficulty of revision may be due to the complexity of the recombination patterns and the need for more advanced techniques to accurately analyze and interpret the data.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, osteopontin enhances endogenous repair after neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury.\n\nExplanation: The context provides information that osteopontin (OPN) is the most highly upregulated factor early after neonatal cerebral hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. The background context also provides information that OPN has been reported to be neuroprotective in stroke animal models. Therefore, it can be concluded that OPN enhances endogenous repair after neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, xenon pretreatment attenuates anesthetic-induced apoptosis in the developing brain in comparison with nitrous oxide and hypoxia.\n\nExplanation: The study found that xenon pretreatment prevented nitrous oxide- and isoflurane-induced neuroapoptosis (in vivo and in vitro) and cognitive deterioration (in vivo). Contrastingly, nitrous oxide- and isoflurane-induced neuroapoptosis was exacerbated by hypoxic pretreatment. Nitrous oxide pretreatment had no effect. Xenon pretreatment increased Bcl-2 expression and decreased both cytochrome C release and P53 expression; conversely, the opposite was evident after hypoxic pretreatment. These findings suggest that xenon pretreatment attenuates anesthetic-induced apoptosis in the developing brain in comparison with nitrous oxide and hypoxia.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, p130 mediates TGF-beta-induced cell-cycle arrest in Rb mutant HT-3 cells. TGF-beta markedly enhanced the binding of p21 with cdk2 but decreased that of cdk2 with cyclin E and inhibited the phosphorylation of p130 but did not change Rb and p107 protein status. We also found that E2F-1 protein level was lower in TGF-beta-treated cells and suggest that this might be the result of enhanced binding between E2F-4 and p130.",

      "\nAnswer: No, caffeic acid phenethyl ester does not decrease acute pneumonitis after irradiation in vitro and in vivo.\n\nExplanation: The provided context and background context do not mention anything about the effects of caffeic acid phenethyl ester on acute pneumonitis after irradiation. The only mention of acute pneumonitis is in the context of radiation pneumonitis being a major obstacle to increasing the radiation dose. However, the context does mention that caffeic acid phenethyl ester induces apoptosis and increases radiosensitivity in lung cancer. Therefore, it is possible that caffeic acid phenethyl ester could be used as an adjuvant agent for lung cancer treatment, but it does not decrease acute pneumonitis after irradiation.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, thymoglobulin administered early after heart transplantation reduces early myocardial hypertrophy assessed by morphometric studies.\n\nExplanation: The study investigated the effects of early thymoglobulin administration on cardiocyte nuclear status in orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) recipients. The study evaluated endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs) from 31 OHT recipients and 10 control cases. OHT patients were divided into the standard group who were treated without thymoglobuline; an ATG group who received thymoglobulin electively, and a standard+ATG group who were administered thymoglobulin upon a drop in renal function. The study evaluated only EMBs obtained at 1 and 4 weeks after OHT showing no significant rejection (ISHLT grades 0 to 1B). The morphometric studies were performed using a computerized, automated Quantimet image analysis system. Overall, 1750 cardiocyte nuclei were quantitated for area, length, breadth, perimeter, chromatin median grey level, and fullness factor. The study found that thymoglobulin administered early after heart transplantation reduces early myocardial hypertrophy assessed by morphometric studies.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, dNA-PKcs expression is a predictor of biochemical recurrence after permanent Iodine 125 interstitial brachytherapy for prostate cancer.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe provided context discusses the results of a study that evaluated the association of various pretreatment variables with biochemical recurrence (BCR) after permanent Iodine 125 interstitial brachytherapy for prostate cancer. The study included 92 men who underwent brachytherapy with a 145 Gy delivered dose between 2000 and 2008. Pretreatment prostate biopsies were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and FISH for ERG rearrangement and overexpression, PTEN deletion, and expression loss.\n\nThe study found that positive DNA-PKcs nuclear staining (P=.003) and higher Ku70 expression (P=.05) were associated with BCR. On multivariate analysis, among pretreatment variables, only DNA-PKcs (P=.03) and clinical stage (P=.02) remained predictive of recurrence. None of the patients without palpable PCa and negative DNA-PKcs expression experienced biochemical failure, compared",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, chemotherapy for cancer causes apoptosis that precedes hypoplasia in crypts of the small intestine in humans.\n\nExplanation: The study found that chemotherapy for cancer caused apoptosis that preceded hypoplasia in crypts of the small intestine in humans. The study also found that chemotherapy for cancer caused a decrease in villus area, crypt length, mitotic count per crypt, and enterocyte height. The study also found that disaccharidase activities remained unchanged. Electron microscopy showed increased open tight junctions of enterocytes at day 3, consistent with more immature cells. All indices improved by 16 days.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, alveolar macrophage gene expression is altered in the setting of alcohol use disorders. The study found that whole genome microarray analysis of alveolar macrophages obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage from a test cohort of subjects with AUDs (n = 7), and controls (n = 7) who were pair-matched on age, gender, and smoking, revealed differentially expressed candidate genes based on alcohol consumption.

      "\nAnswer: No, a diminished postnatal surge of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants is not additional evidence for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The study found that the number of Ad spermatogonia in unilateral cryptorchid testes correlated in a nonlinear fashion with those in the contralateral scrotal testes, indicating that the development of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants is not affected by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The study also found that the total number of germ cells in the cryptorchid testes in the first six months of life is normal, after which it declines rapidly. This suggests that the development of Ad spermatogonia in cryptorchid infants is not affected by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.",

However, the study did not find gender and household food insecurity to be associated with stunting among young Pakistani children residing in urban squatter settlements. This is because the study did not include these variables in the final multivariate analysis and so they were excluded from the final model.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, combination therapy with VELCADE and tissue plasminogen activator is neuroprotective in aged rats after stroke and targets microRNA-146a and the toll-like receptor signaling pathway. The study found that combination treatment with VELCADE and tPA reduced infarct volume compared with respective monotherapies. The study also found that the combination treatment increased miR-l46a levels, which was inversely associated with the reduction of vascular interleukin-1 receptor-activated kinases 1 immunoreactivity. In vitro, fibrin upregulated interleukin-1 receptor-activated kinases 1 and TLR4 expression and downregulated miR-146a on primary human cerebral endothelial cells. VELCADE elevated miR-146 levels and abolished fibrin-increased interleukin-1 receptor activated kinases 1 proteins. The study also found that combination therapy with VELCADE and tPA reduced deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL), cleaved caspase-3, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, higher peak weight velocity (PWV) in infancy was associated with a significant increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in children at 10 years. For each 10.2\\u200acm/year [2 standard deviation (SD)] increase in PWV, SBP increased by 2.94 mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.34, 4.54] after adjustment for potential confounders including birth weight and body mass index.

      "\nAnswer: Yes, expression of snail in pancreatic cancer promotes metastasis and chemoresistance.\n\nExplanation: The study found that snail expression was expressed in 36% of pancreatic cancer samples and had a close correlation with lymph node invasion and distant metastasis. After transfecting snail cDNA into pancreatic cancer cell line Panc-1, the study found that snail triggered overt epithelial to mesenchymal transitions in Panc-1 cells, promoting the invasive ability of Panc-1 cells. Moreover, snail-transfected Panc-1 cells produced more spontaneous metastasis than parental untransfected cells after orthotopically injected into the pancreas of nude mice. Additionally, the study found that overexpression of snail enhanced the chemoresistance to 5-fluorouracil of gemcitabine at different dosages.",

      "\nAnswer: Yes, prenatal lipopolysaccharide exposure affects maternal behavior and male offspring sexual behavior in adulthood. The study found that LPS-treated dams presented reduced maternal behavior, decreased general activity, a smaller body weight difference between GD21 and PND1, a greater number of perinatal deaths, and smaller litters. For the male pups, LPS treatment resulted in a decreased body weight on PND2, whereas the anogenital distance and the day of testis descent were not modified. The male sexual behavior was impaired by prenatal LPS. Particularly the number of ejaculating animals was reduced. The testis weight was also lower in the prenatally LPS-treated rats than in the control rats.\n\nIn the first experiment, the maternal behavior (postnatal day, PND, 6) and the dam's open-field general activity (PND7) were evaluated. In the second experiment, the maternal pre- and postnatal parameters, the pup's development, the offspring's sexual behavior in adulthood, and the pup's organ weights were assessed.",

This suggests that pitching biomechanics may change as a pitcher fatigues, leading to a decrease in performance and an increased risk of injury.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, the Bisphosphonate Pamidronate is an Intestinal Antiinflammatory Agent in Rat and Mouse Experimental Colitis.\n\nExplanation: The study found that Pamidronate, but not ibandronate or alendronate, improves chemically induced trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid and dextran sulfate sodium colitis in rats and extends this beneficial effect to lymphocyte transfer colitis. Pamidronate has no effect on intestinal epithelial cells in vitro in terms of cytokine/chemokine release, but enhances IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, and IL-10 production by T cells in coculture. Pamidronate also exerts a direct immunomodulatory effect on T cells, favoring Th1 differentiation and impairing Th17 polarization. These findings suggest that Pamidronate has an intestinal antiinflammatory effect in rat and mouse experimental colitis.",
      "\nAnswer: No, experience with bilateral cochlear implants does not improve sound localization acuity in children.\n\nExplanation: The provided context and background context do not mention anything about children or sound localization acuity. The context and background context only mention the abilities of adults who use bilateral cochlear implants to localize sounds and segregate speech from interfering sounds in a complex auditory environment. The context and background context also mention the change in speech intelligibility under bilateral and unilateral listening modes as a function of bilateral experience during the first 6 mo of activation. The context and background context also mention the correlation between localization and speech intelligibility in the presence of interfering speech and the specific relationship between the bilateral listening mode and the correlation. The context and background context also mention the emergence of sound lateralization (right versus left) before sound localization within a hemifield. However, none of these aspects mention anything about children or sound localization acuity. Therefore, the answer is no, experience with bilateral cochlear implants does not improve sound localization acuity in children.",

      "\nAnswer: Yes, air quality influences the prevalence of hay fever and sinusitis. The National Health Interview Survey for the calendar years 1997-2006 adult sample was analyzed to determine for each calendar year the one-year period prevalence of the two respiratory conditions, hay fever and sinusitis and the nonrespiratory (control) condition, weak/failing kidneys. From the Environmental Protection Agency, yearly historical data for air quality criteria pollutants, carbon monoxide, nitrous dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter, were tabulated. Graphical and linear regression analyses were conducted for each disease condition against each of the air quality variables to determine if higher pollutant concentrations predicted a higher prevalence for the disease condition. For the control condition of kidney failure/weakening, the standardized regression coefficient with air quality was very small (range-0.001-0.004). For hay fever and sinusitis, substantially larger coefficients were obtained ranging from 0.0120-.016 and 0.013-0.027, respectively.\n\nThe Background Context provides additional information about the relationship between air quality and nasal irritation, which is an important element of the response to indoor and outdoor air pollution.

      "\nAnswer: No, risedronate gastrointestinal absorption is dependent on site and rate of administration. In study A, no statistically significant site-specific differences in any pharmacokinetic parameter were observed. However, based on the area under the serum concentration-time profile and the amount of drug excreted in the urine unchanged, the extent of risedronate absorption did not differ significantly following a rapid or a slow infusion in study B. This suggests that the rate of administration affects the absorption of risedronate. Additionally, the site of administration also affects the absorption of risedronate, as observed in study A where no statistically significant site-specific differences were found. Therefore, risedronate gastrointestinal absorption is dependent on both site and rate of administration.",

      "\nAnswer: The present study investigated the biochemical mechanisms of EA anti-inflammation in a rat model. Three experiments were conducted on male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 7-8/per group). Inflammation was induced by injecting complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) subcutaneously into the plantar surface of one hind paw. Experiment 1 measured plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels to see if EA regulates CORT secretion. Experiment 2 studied the effects of the adrenal gland on the therapeutic actions of EA using adrenalectomy (ADX) rats. Experiment 3 determined whether a prototypical glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, RU486, affects EA anti-edema. EA treatment, 10 Hz at 3 mA and 0.1 ms pulse width, was given twice, for 20 min each, once immediately after CFA administration and again 2 h post-CFA. Plasma CORT levels, paw thickness, indicative of the intensity of inflammation, and paw withdrawal latency (PWL) were measured 2 h and 5 h after the CFA injection.

      "\nAnswer: No, urinary concentration does not exclusively rely on plasma vasopressin. The study found no difference in urine osmolality and aquaporin-2 excretion between genders. However, there was a trend towards a higher reabsorption of free water in males. The study also found a diurnal rhythm in plasma vasopressin with a night-time increase in both genders, but no diurnal rhythm in urinary osmolality or aquaporin-2 excretion. The study did not find a correlation between plasma vasopressin and urinary concentration or urinary osmolality.",
      "\nAnswer: No, plasma levels of angiostatin and endostatin are elevated for 2-4 weeks after colorectal cancer surgery.\n\nExplanation: The study assessed plasma levels of angiostatin and endostatin in colorectal cancer patients undergoing minimally invasive colorectal resection (MICR). Blood samples were taken preoperatively and on postoperative day (POD) 1 and 3 in all patients; in a subset, samples were taken between POD 7 and 20. The study found that plasma levels of angiostatin and endostatin were elevated for 2-4 weeks after MICR.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, adherence to the 2006 American Heart Association Diet and Lifestyle Recommendations (AHA-DLR) is associated with bone health in older Puerto Ricans. In a cross-sectional study of 933 Puerto Ricans aged 47-79 y, the AHA-DLS was modified to test associations with bone health. Bone mineral density (BMD) at the femoral neck, trochanter, total hip, and lumbar spine (L2-L4) was measured by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The study found that adherence to the AHA-DLR was associated with higher BMD at all four sites.\n\nIn another study, the 10-y risk of CHD was assessed with the Framingham risk score (FRS) in participants free of cardiovascular disease. CRP was measured in fasting serum. The study found that higher CRP levels were associated with a higher risk of CHD.\n\nIn summary, adherence to the 2006 American Heart Association Diet and Lifestyle Recommendations (AHA-DLR) is associated with both bone health and cardiovascular disease risk reduction in older Puerto Ricans.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, basophils are recruited to inflamed lungs in mice and humans and exacerbate memory Th2 responses.\n\nExplanation: The provided context and background context both mention that basophils are recruited to inflamed lungs in mice and humans and exacerbate memory Th2 responses. The context also mentions that basophils interact with lung CD4 effectors to increase T cell survival and Th2 cytokine expression at the single cell level and amplify OVA-loaded DC-driven Th2 differentiation. The background context also mentions that basophils can act as antigen-presenting cells (APC) inducing Th2-mediated immune responses against parasites or protease allergens.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, inhibition of Toll-like receptor 4 with eritoran attenuates myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.\n\nExplanation: The study reports that eritoran, a specific TLR4 antagonist, attenuated myocardial infarction size in C3H/HeJ mice subjected to myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MI/R) injury. The study also investigated the ligand-activating TLR4 during MI/R injury and found that eritoran reduced JNK phosphorylation, less nuclear NF-kappaB translocation, and a decrease in cytokine expression. These findings suggest that eritoran inhibits the activation of TLR4 and reduces the inflammatory response during MI/R injury, which ultimately attenuates myocardial infarction size.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate supplementation affects Walker 256 tumor-bearing rats in a time-dependent manner.\n\nExplanation: The study found that beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate supplementation had anti-catabolic properties and affected metabolic parameters in both tumor models. The study also found that the effects of beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate supplementation were time-dependent, with the highest levels of \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate observed in animals fed the ketogenic diet and the longest median survival seen in animals fed the ketogenic diet plus radiation treatment. Additionally, the study found that the effects of beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate supplementation were more than additive when combined with radiation treatment, with the bioluminescent signal from the tumor cells diminishing below the level of detection in 9 of 11 irradiated animals maintained on the ketogenic diet.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, nT-ProBNP predicts rhythm stability after cardioversion of lone atrial fibrillation.\n\nExplanation: The study found that NT-proBNP serum levels were significantly higher in patients who experienced a relapse of AF after cardioversion compared to patients who were in sinus rhythm during follow-up. Additionally, the study found that NT-proBNP was significantly higher prior to cardioversion in patients who experienced a relapse of AF compared to patients who did not experience a relapse. These findings suggest that NT-proBNP can be used as a predictor of rhythm stability after cardioversion of lone atrial fibrillation.",
      "\nAnswer: No indication of impairment to the haematological indices measured, hepatic function, or muscle damage was apparent after Cr supplementation. In contrast to previous reports, no detrimental effects of creatine supplementation on the renal function indices were observed in two-thirds nephrectomized or sham-operated animals. No differences were observed in inulin (0.28+/-0.08 vs 0.25+/-0.08 ml/min/100 g; P=NS) or creatinine clearance rates. Serum cystatin C concentration, urinary protein excretion, and albumin and urea clearance were comparable between creatine-supplemented and control-diet fed animals in both sham-operated and two-thirds nephrectomized animals. Serum creatine and intramuscular total creatine concentrations were higher in creatine-supplemented groups (P<0.05).\n\nComment: I'm not sure what you're asking.

      "\nAnswer: Yes, the cAMP effectors Epac and PKA are involved in the hepatic cystogenesis of an animal model of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease ( ARPKD ). The study found that both normal and PCK cholangiocytes increase their growth upon Epac-specific stimulation, while PKA-specific stimulation results in differential effects, suppressing proliferation in normal cholangiocytes but accelerating this process in PCK cholangiocytes. On the other hand, both PKA and Epac activation of cystic structures generated by normal and PCK cholangiocytes when cultured under three-dimensional conditions resulted in increased cyst growth, particularly in PCK-cholangiocyte derived cysts. Pharmacological inhibitors and small interfering RNA-mediated gene silencing demonstrated the specificity of each effector activation, as well as the involvement of MEK-ERK1/2 signaling in all the observed effector-associated proliferation changes. Hyperproliferation of PCK cholangiocytes in response to PKA stimulation, but not to Epac stimulation, was found to be associated with decreased intracellular calcium, and restoration of calcium levels blocked the PKA-dependent proliferation via the PI3",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, chronic administration of atypical antipsychotics, specifically risperidone and clozapine, improves behavioral and synaptic defects of STOP null mice.\n\nExplanation: The provided context and background context describe the effects of STOP gene deletion in mice and the effects of atypical antipsychotics on STOP null mice behavior and synaptic plasticity. The context describes that STOP null mice display synaptic defects in glutamatergic neurons, hyper-dopaminergy, and severe behavioral disorders. The background context describes that synaptic and behavioral deficits are amended by neuroleptic treatment in STOP-null mice. The provided context describes that long-term administration of either risperidone or clozapine results in alleviation of behavioral alterations mimicking some negative symptoms and partial amelioration of some cognitive defects in STOP null mice. The background context describes that clozapine treatment also improves synaptic plasticity of the STOP null animals by restoring long-term potentiation in the hippocampus. Therefore, the answer is yes, chronic administration of atypical antipsychotics improves behavioral and synaptic defects of STOP null mice.",
      "\nAnswer: The study was designed to clarify whether the association between Chlamydia pneumoniae (CP) and atherosclerotic disease is based on CP-induced transformation of a stable into an unstable atherosclerotic plaque or on stimulation of hypercoagulability leading to increased thrombotic arterial occlusions by CP infection. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonographic monitoring of the middle cerebral artery during carotid endarterectomy offers the opportunity to study, before removal of the plaque, atherothrombotic emboli dislodging from an unstable carotid plaque (plaque-related emboli) and emboli related to (excessive) thrombus formation at the endarterectomy site after removal of the plaque and restoration of flow (thrombosis-related emboli).\n\nThe study was not designed to determine whether CP influences atherosclerotic plaque behavior in patients with established carotid artery stenosis.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, moxibustion activates mast cell degranulation at the ST25 in rats with colitis.\n\nExplanation: The study investigates the effects of moxibustion on the morphology and function of mast cells (MC) at Tianshu (ST25) in rats with trinitro-benzene-sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis. The study found that rats in the moxibustion group had significantly increased mast cell degranulation at ST25 compared to the normal group and other experimental groups. Therefore, moxibustion activates mast cell degranulation at the ST25 in rats with colitis.",
      "\nAnswer: Yes, optic nerve blood flow is diminished in eyes of primary open-angle glaucoma suspects.\n\nExplanation: The study compared optic nerve blood flow in primary open-angle glaucoma suspects with corresponding measurements from controls and eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma. The study found that the mean flow from the superotemporal rim, inferotemporal rim, and cup was significantly lower in primary open-angle glaucoma suspects compared to controls and eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma. This suggests that optic nerve blood flow is diminished in eyes of primary open-angle glaucoma suspects."

These findings need further elucidation.",
    "MICR has a very transient impact on plasma levels of endostatin and no impact on angiostatin during the first 21 days following surgery. Thus, angiostatin and endostatin do not likely contribute to or inhibit the persistent proangiogenic changes noted after MICR.",
    "Dietary guidelines for CVD risk reduction may also benefit bone health in this Hispanic cohort. Synchronizing dietary guidelines for these 2 common diseases may provide a simplified public health message. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01231958.",
    "Basophils may worsen Th2 inflammatory disorders through direct interactions with pathogenic CD4 T cells as well as by enhancing DC-induced Th2 cell development.",
    "We conclude that inhibition of TLR4 with eritoran in an in situ murine model significantly reduces MI/R injury and markers of an inflammatory response.",
    "HMbeta supplementation can increase survival time and promotes metabolic changes in cancer-bearing animals, but it seems to work in a time-dependent manner.",
    "The probability of a successful cardioversion correlates inversely with NT-proBNP values. The short-term success of a cardioversion might be predicted by prior determination of NT-proBNP.",
    "These data provide evidence that there are no obvious adverse effects of acute or more chronic Cr supplementation on the haematological indices measured, nor on hepatic, muscle, and renal function. Therefore there is no apparent health risk associated with Cr supplementation to healthy people when it is ingested in quantities that have been scientifically proven to increase muscle Cr stores.",
    "Our data provide strong evidence that both cAMP effectors, Epac and PKA, and the levels of intracellular calcium are involved in the hepatic cystogenesis of ARPKD.",
    "All together, the pharmacological reactivity of STOP null mice to antipsychotics evokes the pharmacological response of humans to such drugs. Totally, our study suggests that STOP null mice may provide a useful preclinical model to evaluate pharmacological properties of antipsychotic drugs.",
    "This study confirms that C pneumoniae is a common finding in atherosclerotic plaques of the carotid artery but suggests that the presence of the infectious organism has little detectable impact on plaque instability when measured by clinically significant markers. This raises important questions for the rationale of antibiotic therapy in atherosclerosis.",
    "Moxibustion exerted its effect on healing impaired colonic mucosa in rats with TNBS-induced colitis by increasing the degranulation ratio of local MC, but had little effect on the morphology of MC at ST25 acupoint.",
    "Laser Doppler flowmetry detected circulatory abnormalities in primary open-angle glaucoma suspects who did not have any manifest visual field defect. Decreases in flow in glaucoma suspects were similar in magnitude to those of subjects with primary open-angle glaucoma. These data suggest that impaired optic nerve blood flow develops early in the glaucomatous process and does not develop solely as a result of glaucoma damage."
